    <br>river, but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the 
    <br>Missouri its main branch, it is the longest river in the world—four 
    <br>thousand three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also the 
    <br>crookedest river in the world, since in one part of its journey it uses up 
    <br>one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the 
    <br>crow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It discharges three 
    <br>times as much water as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much as 
    <br>the Rhine, and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the 
    <br>Thames. No other river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water 
    <br>supply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Atlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that and Idaho on 
    <br>the Pacific slope—a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude. The 
    <br>Mississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four 
    <br>subordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats, and from some 
    <br>hundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its drainage-
    <br>basin is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales, Scotland, 
    <br>Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Turkey; 
    <br>and almost all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi valley, proper, is 
    <br>exceptionally so. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:1450px; width:454px; height:142px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">It is a remarkable river in this: that instead of widening toward its 
    <br>mouth, it grows narrower; grows narrower and deeper. From the 
    <br>junction of the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width 
    <br>averages a mile in high water: thence to the sea the width steadily 
    <br>diminishes, until, at the ‘Passes,’ above the mouth, it is but little over half 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">a mile. At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi’s depth is eighty-seven 
    <br>feet; the depth increases gradually, reaching one hundred and twenty-
    <br>nine just above the mouth. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:1606px; width:454px; height:87px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The difference in rise and fall is also remarkable—not in the upper, but in 
    <br>the lower river. The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez (three 
    <br>hundred and sixty miles above the mouth)—about fifty feet. But at Bayou 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New Orleans only 
    <br>fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one half.

    <br>able engineers, states that the river annually empties four hundred and 
    <br>six million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico—which brings to mind 
    <br>Captain Marryat’s rude name for the Mississippi—‘the Great Sewer.’ This 
    <br>mud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and 
    <br>forty-one feet high. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2028px; width:453px; height:160px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The mud deposit gradually extends the land—but only gradually; it has 
    <br>extended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which 
    <br>have elapsed since the river took its place in history. The belief of the 
    <br>scientific people is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge, where the 
    <br>hills cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between there and the 
    <br>Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the age of that piece of country, 
    <br>without any trouble at all—one hundred and twenty thousand years. Yet 
    <br>it is much the youthfullest batch of country that lies around there 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">anywhere. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2203px; width:453px; height:142px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The Mississippi is remarkable in still another way—its disposition to 
    <br>make prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land, and 
    <br>thus straightening and shortening itself. More than once it has shortened 
    <br>itself thirty miles at a single jump! These cut-offs have had curious 
    <br>effects: they have thrown several river towns out into the rural districts, 
    <br>and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. The town of Delta 
    <br>used to be three miles below Vicksburg: a recent cutoff has radically 
    <br>changed the position, and Delta is now </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">two miles above</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> Vicksburg. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2359px; width:452px; height:142px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Both of these river towns have been retired to the country by that cut-off. 
    <br>A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions: for instance, 
    <br>a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day, a cut-off occurs to-
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">night, and to-morrow the man finds himself and his land over on the 
    <br>other side of the river, within the boundaries and subject to the laws of 
    <br>the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening in the upper river in the 
    <br>old times, could have transferred a slave from Missouri to Illinois and 
    <br>made a free man of him. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:2515px; width:449px; height:87px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: it is always 
    <br>changing its habitat </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">bodily</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">—is always moving bodily </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">sidewise</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">. At Hard 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Times, La., the river is two miles west of the region it used to occupy. As 
    <br>a result, the original </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">site </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of that settlement is not now in Louisiana at all,

    <br>historical history—so to speak. We can glance briefly at its slumbrous 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">first epoch in a couple of short chapters; at its second and wider-awake 
    <br>epoch in a couple more; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good 
    <br>many succeeding chapters; and then talk about its comparatively 
    <br>tranquil present epoch in what shall be left of the book.

    <br>word ‘new’ in connection with our country, that we early get and 
    <br>permanently retain the impression that there is nothing old about it. We 
    <br>do of course know that there are several comparatively old dates in 
    <br>American history, but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea, 
    <br>no distinct realization, of the stretch of time which they represent. To say 
    <br>that De Soto, the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi River, saw 
    <br>it in 1542, is a remark which states a fact without interpreting it: it is 
    <br>something like giving the dimensions of a sunset by astronomical 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their scientific names;—as 
    <br>a result, you get the bald fact of the sunset, but you don’t see the sunset. 
    <br>It would have been better to paint a picture of it.

    <br>one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it, he 
    <br>adds perspective and color, and then realizes that this is one of the 
    <br>American dates which is quite respectable for age.

    <br>and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,—the act which began 
    <br>the Reformation. When De Soto took his glimpse of the river, Ignatius 
    <br>Loyola was an obscure name; the order of the Jesuits was not yet a year 
    <br>old; Michael Angelo’s paint was not yet dry on the Last Judgment in the 
    <br>Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born, but would be 
    <br>before the year closed. Catherine de Medici was a child; Elizabeth of 
    <br>England was not yet in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto Cellini, and the 
    <br>Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and each was 
    <br>manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; Margaret of 
    <br>Navarre was writing the ‘Heptameron’ and some religious books,—the 
    <br>first survives, the others are forgotten, wit and indelicacy being 
    <br>sometimes better literature preservers than holiness; lax court morals

    <br>the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire; in 
    <br>England, Henry VIII. had suppressed the monasteries, burnt Fisher and 
    <br>another bishop or two, and was getting his English reformation and his 
    <br>harem effectively started. When De Soto stood on the banks of the 
    <br>Mississippi, it was still two years before Luther’s death; eleven years 
    <br>before the burning of Servetus; thirty years before the St. Bartholomew 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">slaughter; Rabelais was not yet published; ‘Don Quixote’ was not yet

    <br>priests and soldiers. One would expect the priests and the soldiers to 
    <br>multiply the river’s dimensions by ten—the Spanish custom of the day—
    <br>and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On the 
    <br>contrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite that 
    <br>amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites during 
    <br>a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One may 
    <br>‘sense’ the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it up in this 
    <br>way: After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short of a quarter of a 
    <br>century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a trifle more than 
    <br>half a century, then died; and when he had been in his grave 
    <br>considerably more than half a century, the </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">second </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">white man saw the 
    <br>Mississippi. In our day we don’t allow a hundred and thirty years to 
    <br>elapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should discover a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">creek in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe and 
    <br>America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to explore the 
    <br>creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:4905px; width:454px; height:343px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">For more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white 
    <br>settlements on our Atlantic coasts. These people were in intimate 
    <br>communication with the Indians: in the south the Spaniards were 
    <br>robbing, slaughtering, enslaving and converting them; higher up, the 
    <br>English were trading beads and blankets to them for a consideration, 
    <br>and throwing in civilization and whiskey, ‘for lagniappe;’ and in Canada 
    <br>the French were schooling them in a rudimentary way, missionarying 
    <br>among them, and drawing whole populations of them at a time to 
    <br>Quebec, and later to Montreal, to buy furs of them. Necessarily, then, 
    <br>these various clusters of whites must have heard of the great river of the 
    <br>far west; and indeed, they did hear of it vaguely,—so vaguely and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">indefinitely, that its course, proportions, and locality were hardly even 
    <br>guessable. The mere mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired 
    <br>curiosity and compelled exploration; but this did not occur. Apparently 
    <br>nobody happened to want such a river, nobody needed it, nobody was 
    <br>curious about it; so, for a century and a half the Mississippi remained out 
    <br>of the market and undisturbed. When De Soto found it, he was not 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">hunting for a river, and had no present occasion for one; consequently he 
    <br>did not value it or even take any particular notice of it.

    <br>Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore afforded a 
    <br>short cut from Canada to China. Previously the supposition had been 
    <br>that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of Virginia.

    <br>them was the privilege to explore, far and wide, and build forts, and 
    <br>stake out continents, and hand the same over to the king, and pay the 
    <br>expenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages of one sort 
    <br>or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides. He spent several 
    <br>years and about all of his money, in making perilous and painful trips 
    <br>between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois, before he 
    <br>at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape that he could

    <br>merchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed the country and reached the 
    <br>banks of the Mississippi. They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from 
    <br>Green Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette 
    <br>had solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, 
    <br>that if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would 
    <br>name it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all 
    <br>explorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four with 
    <br>him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of meat, 
    <br>and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other 
    <br>requisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint 
    <br>chroniclers of the time phrased it, to ‘explain hell to the savages.’

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the 
    <br>Mississippi. Mr. Parkman says: ‘Before them a wide and rapid current 
    <br>coursed athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in 
    <br>forests.’ He continues: ‘Turning southward, they paddled down the 
    <br>stream, through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man.’

    <br>then. And it is now, over most of its stretch.

    <br>men in the mud of the western bank—a Robinson Crusoe experience 
    <br>which carries an electric shiver with it yet, when one stumbles on it in 
    <br>print. They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and 
    <br>pitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without waiting for 
    <br>provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette struck into the country 
    <br>to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks. They found them, by and by, and 
    <br>were hospitably received and well treated—if to be received by an Indian 
    <br>chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear at his level best is 
    <br>to be received hospitably; and if to be treated abundantly to fish, 
    <br>porridge, and other game, including dog, and have these things forked 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">into one’s mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians is to be well treated. 
    <br>In the morning the chief and six hundred of his tribesmen escorted the 
    <br>Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly farewell.

    <br>the Mississippi, boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">branches, and uprooted trees.’ This was the mouth of the Missouri, ‘that

    <br>they fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day after day, through the 
    <br>deep silence and loneliness of the river, drowsing in the scant shade of 
    <br>makeshift awnings, and broiling with the heat; they encountered and 
    <br>exchanged civilities with another party of Indians; and at last they 
    <br>reached the mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their

    <br>meet and murder them; but they appealed to the Virgin for help; so in

    <br>He was provokingly delayed, by one misfortune after another, but at last 
    <br>got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681. In the dead of 
    <br>winter he and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who invented the 
    <br>tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a following of 
    <br>eighteen Indians brought from New England, and twenty-three 
    <br>Frenchmen. They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen 
    <br>river, on foot, and dragging their canoes after them on sledges.

    <br>the Ohio, by-and-by; ‘and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp, 
    <br>landed on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs,’ where 
    <br>they halted and built Fort Prudhomme.

    <br>forests, and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas. First, they 
    <br>were greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before been 
    <br>greeted by them—with the booming of the war drum and the flourish of 
    <br>arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette’s case; the pipe of 
    <br>peace did the same office for La Salle. The white man and the red man 
    <br>struck hands and entertained each other during three days. Then, to the 
    <br>admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the arms of France 
    <br>on it, and took possession of the whole country for the king—the cool 
    <br>fashion of the time—while the priest piously consecrated the robbery 
    <br>with a hymn. The priest explained the mysteries of the faith ‘by signs,’ for 
    <br>the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with possible 
    <br>possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they had just 
    <br>been robbed of. And also, by signs, La Salle drew from these simple 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the Putrid, over 
    <br>the water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.

    <br>Napoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised on 
    <br>the banks of the great river. Marquette’s and Joliet’s voyage of discovery 
    <br>ended at the same spot—the site of the future town of Napoleon. When 
    <br>De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back in the dim early 
    <br>days, he took it from that same spot—the site of the future town of 
    <br>Napoleon, Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the four memorable events 
    <br>connected with the discovery and exploration of the mighty river, 
    <br>occurred, by accident, in one and the same place. It is a most curious 
    <br>distinction, when one comes to look at it and think about it. France stole 
    <br>that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon; and by and by 
    <br>Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!—make restitution, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.

    <br>imposing Indian monarch in the Teche country, whose capital city was a 
    <br>substantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw—better houses 
    <br>than many that exist there now. The chiefs house contained an audience 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">room forty feet square; and there he received Tonty in State, surrounded

    <br>waters of the Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy achieved. Mr.

    <br>from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of the Gulf; from 
    <br>the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks of the Rocky 
    <br>Mountains—a region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked deserts and 
    <br>grassy prairies, watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by a thousand

    <br>broadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New 
    <br>Orleans, changed cargoes there, and were tediously warped and poled 
    <br>back by hand. A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine 
    <br>months. In time this commerce increased until it gave employment to 
    <br>hordes of rough and hardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering 
    <br>terrific hardships with sailor-like stoicism; heavy drinkers, coarse 
    <br>frolickers in moral sties like the Natchez-under-the-hill of that day, 
    <br>heavy fighters, reckless fellows, every one, elephantinely jolly, foul-
    <br>witted, profane; prodigal of their money, bankrupt at the end of the trip, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">fond of barbaric finery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, 
    <br>trustworthy, faithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely 
    <br>magnanimous.

    <br>men continued to run their keelboats down-stream, and the steamers did 
    <br>all of the upstream business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in New 
    <br>Orleans, and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.

    <br>was flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, all managed by hand, and 
    <br>employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to 
    <br>describe. I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used to 
    <br>glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,—an acre or so of white, sweet-
    <br>smelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men or more, three or 
    <br>four wigwams scattered about the raft’s vast level space for storm-
    <br>quarters,—and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk of 
    <br>their big crews, the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning 
    <br>successors; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">on these rafts and have a ride.

    <br>and hardly-remembered raft-life, I will throw in, in this place, a chapter 
    <br>from a book which I have been working at, by fits and starts, during the 
    <br>past five or six years, and may possibly finish in the course of five or six 
    <br>more. The book is a story which details some passages in the life of an 
    <br>ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the town drunkard of my time 
    <br>out west, there. He has run away from his persecuting father, and from a 
    <br>persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice, truth-telling, 
    <br>respectable boy of him; and with him a slave of the widow’s has also 
    <br>escaped. They have found a fragment of a lumber raft (it is high water 
    <br>and dead summer time), and are floating down the river by night, and 
    <br>hiding in the willows by day,—bound for Cairo,—whence the negro will 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">seek freedom in the heart of the free States. But in a fog, they pass Cairo 
    <br>without knowing it. By and by they begin to suspect the truth, and Huck 
    <br>Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by swimming down to a 
    <br>huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead of them, creeping 
    <br>aboard under cover of the darkness, and gathering the needed 
    <br>information by eavesdropping:—

    <br>out for the raft’s light. By and by, when I got down nearly to her, I eased 
    <br>up and went slow and cautious. But everything was all right—nobody at

    <br>in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather side of the fire. 
    <br>There was thirteen men there—they was the watch on deck of course.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and it wasn’t a nice song—for a parlor anyway. He roared through his 
    <br>nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long. When he was

    <br>sung. It begun:—

    <br>Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and spread! I put my hand on the sun’s face 
    <br>and make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry 
    <br>the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the mountains! Contemplate me 
    <br>through leather—don’t use the naked eye! I’m the man with a petrified 
    <br>heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre of isolated communities is the 
    <br>pastime of my idle moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">business of my life! The boundless vastness of the great American desert 
    <br>is my enclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!’ He 
    <br>jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he lit (they 
    <br>cheered him again), and as he come down he shouted out: ‘Whoo-oop! 
    <br>bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of calamity’s a-coming!’

    <br>one—the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity chipped in 
    <br>again, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the same time, 
    <br>swelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into 
    <br>each other’s faces, and whooping and jawing like Injuns; then Bob called 
    <br>the Child names, and the Child called him names back again: next, Bob 
    <br>called him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with 
    <br>the very worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child’s hat off, 
    <br>and the Child picked it up and kicked Bob’s ribbony hat about six foot; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Bob went and got it and said never mind, this warn’t going to be the last 
    <br>of this thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive, 
    <br>and so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, just as 
    <br>sure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer to him with 
    <br>the best blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than he 
    <br>was for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning, now, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">never to cross his path again, for he could never rest till he had waded in 
    <br>his blood, for such was his nature, though he was sparing him now on 
    <br>account of his family, if he had one.

    <br>how the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the way 
    <br>through, and shout ‘Sail in, Corpse-Maker!’ ‘Hi! at him again, Child of 
    <br>Calamity!’ ‘Bully for you, little Davy!’ Well, it was a perfect pow-wow for 
    <br>a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they got 
    <br>through. Little Davy made them own up that they were sneaks and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">cowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger; then Bob 
    <br>and the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they 
    <br>had always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be 
    <br>bygones. So then they washed their faces in the river; and just then there 
    <br>was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went 
    <br>forward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft to handle the 
    <br>after-sweeps.

    <br>that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, and they 
    <br>stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing 
    <br>again. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one played and another patted 
    <br>juba, and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular old-fashioned 
    <br>keel-boat break-down. They couldn’t keep that up very long without

    <br>there was a regular storm, and in the middle of it a man that was running

    <br>more. Crippled them how, says you? Why, sprained their ankles!

    <br>comrades in our village {footnote [1. Hannibal, Missouri]} on the west 
    <br>bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had 
    <br>transient ambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a 
    <br>circus came and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first 
    <br>negro minstrel show that came to our section left us all suffering to try 
    <br>that kind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were 
    <br>good, God would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, 
    <br>each in its turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always 
    <br>remained.

    <br>another downward from Keokuk. Before these events, the day was 
    <br>glorious with expectancy; after them, the day was a dead and empty 
    <br>thing. Not only the boys, but the whole village, felt this. After all these 
    <br>years I can picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the 
    <br>white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer’s morning; the streets 
    <br>empty, or pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water 
    <br>Street stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the 
    <br>wall, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep—with 
    <br>shingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down; a sow 
    <br>and a litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in 
    <br>watermelon rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles 
    <br>scattered about the ‘levee;’ a pile of ‘skids’ on the slope of the stone-
    <br>paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody to 
    <br>listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them; the great 
    <br>Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-
    <br>wide tide along, shining in the sun; the dense forest away on the other 
    <br>side; the ‘point’ above the town, and the ‘point’ below, bounding the 
    <br>river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and 
    <br>brilliant and lonely one. Presently a film of dark smoke appears above 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">one of those remote ‘points;’ instantly a negro drayman, famous for his

    <br>And the boat </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">is</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> rather a handsome sight, too. She is long and sharp and 
    <br>trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded

    <br>and ‘gingerbread’, perched on top of the ‘texas’ deck behind them; the 
    <br>paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the 
    <br>boat’s name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are 
    <br>fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires 
    <br>glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain 
    <br>stands by the big bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of 
    <br>the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys—a 
    <br>husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch pine just before arriving 
    <br>at a town; the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run 
    <br>far out over the port bow, and an envied deckhand stands picturesquely 
    <br>on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is 
    <br>screaming through the gauge-cocks, the captain lifts his hand, a bell 
    <br>rings, the wheels stop; then they turn back, churning the water to foam, 
    <br>and the steamer is at rest. Then such a scramble as there is to get aboard, 
    <br>and to get ashore, and to take in freight and to discharge freight, all at 
    <br>one and the same time; and such a yelling and cursing as the mates 
    <br>facilitate it all with! Ten minutes later the steamer is under way again, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">with no flag on the jack-staff and no black smoke issuing from the 
    <br>chimneys. After ten more minutes the town is dead again, and the town

    <br>end of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because he was 
    <br>particularly conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams,—they were 
    <br>too heavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by one of 
    <br>our boys went away. He was not heard of for a long time. At last he 
    <br>turned up as apprentice engineer or ‘striker’ on a steamboat. This thing 
    <br>shook the bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy had 
    <br>been notoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted to 
    <br>this eminence, and I left in obscurity and misery. There was nothing 
    <br>generous about this fellow in his greatness. He would always manage to 
    <br>have a rusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at our town, and he 
    <br>would sit on the inside guard and scrub it, where we could all see him 
    <br>and envy him and loathe him. And whenever his boat was laid up he 
    <br>would come home and swell around the town in his blackest and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">greasiest clothes, so that nobody could help remembering that he was a 
    <br>steamboatman; and he used all sorts of steamboat technicalities in his 
    <br>talk, as if he were so used to them that he forgot common people could 
    <br>not understand them. He would speak of the ‘labboard’ side of a horse in 
    <br>an easy, natural way that would make one wish he was dead. And he was 
    <br>always talking about ‘St. Looy’ like an old citizen; he would refer casually 
    <br>to occasions when he ‘was coming down Fourth Street,’ or when he was 
    <br>‘passing by the Planter’s House,’ or when there was a fire and he took a 
    <br>turn on the brakes of ‘the old Big Missouri;’ and then he would go on and 
    <br>lie about how many towns the size of ours were burned down there that 
    <br>day. Two or three of the boys had long been persons of consideration 
    <br>among us because they had been to St. Louis once and had a vague 
    <br>general knowledge of its wonders, but the day of their glory was over 
    <br>now. They lapsed into a humble silence, and learned to disappear when 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the ruthless ‘cub’-engineer approached. This fellow had money, too, and 
    <br>hair oil. Also an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch chain. He 
    <br>wore a leather belt and used no suspenders. If ever a youth was cordially 
    <br>admired and hated by his comrades, this one was. No girl could 
    <br>withstand his charms. He ‘cut out’ every boy in the village. When his boat 
    <br>blew up at last, it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such as we 
    <br>had not known for months. But when he came home the next week, alive, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">renowned, and appeared in church all battered up and bandaged, a 
    <br>shining hero, stared at and wondered over by everybody, it seemed to us

    <br>followed. Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister’s son

    <br>‘mud clerks;’ the wholesale liquor dealer’s son became a barkeeper on a 
    <br>boat; four sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge, 
    <br>became pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even in 
    <br>those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary—from a hundred and 
    <br>fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay. Two 
    <br>months of his wages would pay a preacher’s salary for a year. Now some 
    <br>of us were left disconsolate. We could not get on the river—at least our 
    <br>parents would not let us.

    <br>a pilot and could come in glory. But somehow I could not manage it. I 
    <br>went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay packed together like 
    <br>sardines at the long St. Louis wharf, and very humbly inquired for the 
    <br>pilots, but got only a cold shoulder and short words from mates and 
    <br>clerks. I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the time being, 
    <br>but I had comforting daydreams of a future when I should be a great and 
    <br>honored pilot, with plenty of money, and could kill some of these mates 
    <br>and clerks and pay for them.

    <br>and I found myself without an ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. 
    <br>I was in Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out a new career. I had been 
    <br>reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an 
    <br>expedition sent out by our government. It was said that the expedition, 
    <br>owing to difficulties, had not thoroughly explored a part of the country 
    <br>lying about the head-waters, some four thousand miles from the mouth 
    <br>of the river. It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to 
    <br>New Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty dollars left; 
    <br>I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon. This was all the 
    <br>thought I gave to the subject. I never was great in matters of detail. I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient tub called the ‘Paul 
    <br>Jones,’ for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had the scarred 
    <br>and tarnished splendors of ‘her’ main saloon principally to myself, for 
    <br>she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser travelers. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:28130px; width:453px; height:251px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">When we presently got under way and went poking down the broad 
    <br>Ohio, I became a new being, and the subject of my own admiration. I was 
    <br>a traveler! A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an 
    <br>exultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes 
    <br>which I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a 
    <br>glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I was 
    <br>able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had 
    <br>hardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and 
    <br>wood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">boiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank. If they did 
    <br>not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their attention, or 
    <br>moved to a position where they could not help seeing me. And as soon as 
    <br>I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched, and gave other signs of being 
    <br>mightily bored with traveling.

    <br>experienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw that

    <br>the boys and girls at home could see me now.

    <br>hard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river, and lay there four 
    <br>days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part of the 
    <br>boat’s family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger brother to 
    <br>the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this grandeur, or 
    <br>the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those people. I could 
    <br>not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort of presumption 
    <br>in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the least trifle of 
    <br>notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert for an 
    <br>opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came at last. The riotous 
    <br>powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the forecastle, and I 
    <br>went down there and stood around in the way—or mostly skipping out of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">it—till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to bring 
    <br>him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: ‘Tell me where it is—I’ll 
    <br>fetch it!’ 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:28997px; width:452px; height:123px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">If a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the Emperor of 
    <br>Russia, the monarch could not have been more astounded than the mate 
    <br>was. He even stopped swearing. He stood and stared down at me. It took 
    <br>him ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then he 
    <br>said impressively: ‘Well, if this don’t beat hell!’ and turned to his work 
    <br>with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too 
    <br>abstruse for solution. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:29135px; width:450px; height:215px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. I did not go to 
    <br>dinner; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished. I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">did not feel so much like a member of the boat’s family now as before. 
    <br>However, my spirits returned, in installments, as we pursued our way 
    <br>down the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was not in 
    <br>(young) human nature not to admire him. He was huge and muscular, 
    <br>his face was bearded and whiskered all over; he had a red woman and a 
    <br>blue woman tattooed on his right arm,—one on each side of a blue 
    <br>anchor with a red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was 
    <br>sublime. When he was getting out cargo at a landing, I was always where 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I could see and hear. He felt all the majesty of his great position, and 
    <br>made the world feel it, too. When he gave even the simplest order, he

    <br>doing it. If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot 
    <br>farther forward, he would probably say: ‘James, or William, one of you 
    <br>push that plank forward, please;’ but put the mate in his place and he

    <br>off, I began timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with 
    <br>the boat—the night watchman. He snubbed my advances at first, but I 
    <br>presently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe; and that softened him. 
    <br>So he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck, 
    <br>and in time he melted into conversation. He could not well have helped 
    <br>it, I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that I 
    <br>felt honored by his notice. He told me the names of dim capes and 
    <br>shadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night, 
    <br>under the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about himself. He 
    <br>seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a week—
    <br>or rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I. But I drank 
    <br>in his words hungrily, and with a faith that might have moved mountains 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">if it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he was soiled 
    <br>and seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it to me that his grammar 
    <br>was bad, his construction worse, and his profanity so void of art that it 
    <br>was an element of weakness rather than strength in his conversation? He 
    <br>was a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that was enough 
    <br>for me. As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears dripped upon 
    <br>the lantern in his lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy.

    <br>delays, the poor old ‘Paul Jones’ fooled away about two weeks in making 
    <br>the voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans. This gave me a chance to get 
    <br>acquainted with one of the pilots, and he taught me how to steer the 
    <br>boat, and thus made the fascination of river life more potent than ever 
    <br>for me. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:31533px; width:449px; height:123px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">It also gave me a chance to get acquainted with a youth who had taken 
    <br>deck passage—more’s the pity; for he easily borrowed six dollars of me 
    <br>on a promise to return to the boat and pay it back to me the day after we 
    <br>should arrive. But he probably died or forgot, for he never came. It was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">doubtless the former, since he had said his parents were wealthy, and he 
    <br>only traveled deck passage because it was cooler.{footnote [1. ‘Deck’ 
    <br>Passage, i.e. steerage passage.]} 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:31671px; width:453px; height:270px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I soon discovered two things. One was that a vessel would not be likely to 
    <br>sail for the mouth of the Amazon under ten or twelve years; and the 
    <br>other was that the nine or ten dollars still left in my pocket would not 
    <br>suffice for so imposing an exploration as I had planned, even if I could 
    <br>afford to wait for a ship. Therefore it followed that I must contrive a new 
    <br>career. The ‘Paul Jones’ was now bound for St. Louis. I planned a siege 
    <br>against my pilot, and at the end of three hard days he surrendered. He 
    <br>agreed to teach me the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis 
    <br>for five hundred dollars, payable out of the first wages I should receive 
    <br>after graduating. I entered upon the small enterprise of ‘learning’ twelve 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">or thirteen hundred miles of the great Mississippi River with the easy 
    <br>confidence of my time of life. If I had really known what I was about to 
    <br>require of my faculties, I should not have had the courage to begin. I 
    <br>supposed that all a pilot had to do was to keep his boat in the river, and I 
    <br>did not consider that that could be much of a trick, since it was so wide.

    <br>hundreds; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape the side off 
    <br>every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my breath and began to 
    <br>claw the boat away from the danger; and I had my own opinion of the 
    <br>pilot who had known no better than to get us into such peril, but I was 
    <br>too wise to express it. In half a minute I had a wide margin of safety 
    <br>intervening between the ‘Paul Jones’ and the ships; and within ten 
    <br>seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, and Mr. Bixby was going into 
    <br>danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice. I was 
    <br>stung, but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which my 
    <br>chief loafed from side to side of his wheel, and trimmed the ships so 
    <br>closely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent. When he had cooled a 
    <br>little he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current 
    <br>outside, and therefore we must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">benefit of the former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage 
    <br>of the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and 
    <br>leave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:32555px; width:454px; height:233px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Now and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things. Said he, 
    <br>‘This is Six-Mile Point.’ I assented. It was pleasant enough information, 
    <br>but I could not see the bearing of it. I was not conscious that it was a 
    <br>matter of any interest to me. Another time he said, ‘This is Nine-Mile 
    <br>Point.’ Later he said, ‘This is Twelve-Mile Point.’ They were all about 
    <br>level with the water’s edge; they all looked about alike to me; they were 
    <br>monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would change the 
    <br>subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging the shore 
    <br>with affection, and then say: ‘The slack water ends here, abreast this 
    <br>bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.’ So he crossed over. He gave 
    <br>me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either came near 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too far from shore, 
    <br>and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.

    <br>midnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night 
    <br>watchman said—

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">minute later I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my 
    <br>clothes on and the rest in my arms. Mr. Bixby was close behind, 
    <br>commenting. Here was something fresh—this thing of getting up in the 
    <br>middle of the night to go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had 
    <br>never occurred to me at all. I knew that boats ran all night, but somehow 
    <br>I had never happened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a 
    <br>warm bed to run them. I began to fear that piloting was not quite so 
    <br>romantic as I had imagined it was; there was something very real and 
    <br>work-like about this new phase of it.

    <br>big mate was at the wheel, and he had the old tub pointed at a star and 
    <br>was holding her straight up the middle of the river. The shores on either 
    <br>hand were not much more than half a mile apart, but they seemed 
    <br>wonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct. The mate said:— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:33653px; width:274px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘We’ve got to land at Jones’s plantation, sir.’

    <br>come up. Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation 
    <br>on such a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully 
    <br>wanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short 
    <br>answers as my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I 
    <br>desired to ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass 
    <br>enough to really imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night 
    <br>when all plantations were exactly alike and all the same color. But I held 
    <br>in. I used to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.

    <br>He threw open a window, thrust his head out, and such an irruption

    <br>with anything but blank cartridges. However, I did not feel discouraged 
    <br>long. I judged that it was best to make some allowances, for doubtless 
    <br>Mr. Bixby was ‘stretching.’ Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few 
    <br>strokes on the big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night was as 
    <br>black as ink. I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I was not 
    <br>entirely certain that I could see the shore. The voice of the invisible 
    <br>watchman called up from the hurricane deck— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:36004px; width:108px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘What’s this, sir?’

    <br>But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. Mr. Bixby handled the engine 
    <br>bells, and in due time the boat’s nose came to the land, a torch glowed 
    <br>from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darky’s voice on the bank 
    <br>said, ‘Gimme de k’yarpet-bag, Mars’ Jones,’ and the next moment we 
    <br>were standing up the river again, all serene. I reflected deeply awhile, 
    <br>and then said—but not aloud—‘Well, the finding of that plantation was 
    <br>the luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn’t happen again in 
    <br>a hundred years.’ And I fully believed it was an accident, too. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:36235px; width:453px; height:178px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">By the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river, I had 
    <br>learned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman, in daylight, and 
    <br>before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in night-work, 
    <br>but only a trifle. I had a note-book that fairly bristled with the names of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">towns, ‘points,’ bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.; but the information 
    <br>was to be found only in the notebook—none of it was in my head. It 
    <br>made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the river set down; for 
    <br>as our watch was four hours off and four hours on, day and night, there 
    <br>was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time I had slept since the 
    <br>voyage began.

    <br>little ‘Paul Jones’ a large craft. There were other differences, too. The 
    <br>‘Paul Jones’s’ pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap, 
    <br>cramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; room enough 
    <br>to have a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing 
    <br>sofa; leather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots 
    <br>sit, to spin yarns and ‘look at the river;’ bright, fanciful ‘cuspadores’ 
    <br>instead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth on 
    <br>the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my head, 
    <br>costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs for the 
    <br>bells; and a tidy, white-aproned, black ‘texas-tender,’ to bring up tarts 
    <br>and ices and coffee during mid-watch, day and night. Now this was 
    <br>‘something like,’ and so I began to take heart once more to believe that 
    <br>piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all. The moment we were 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself with 
    <br>joy. She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I looked 
    <br>down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a splendid 
    <br>tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter, on every 
    <br>stateroom door; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed chandeliers; 
    <br>the clerk’s office was elegant, the bar was marvelous, and the bar-keeper 
    <br>had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost. The boiler deck 
    <br>(i.e. the second story of the boat, so to speak) was as spacious as a 
    <br>church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; and there was no pitiful 
    <br>handful of deckhands, firemen, and roustabouts down there, but a whole 
    <br>battalion of men. The fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of 
    <br>furnaces, and over them were eight huge boilers! This was unutterable 
    <br>pomp. The mighty engines—but enough of this. I had never felt so fine

    <br>Here was a piece of river which was all down in my book, but I could 
    <br>make neither head nor tail of it: you understand, it was turned around. I 
    <br>had seen it when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see 
    <br>how it looked when it was behind me. My heart broke again, for it was 
    <br>plain that I had got to learn this troublesome river </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">both ways</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:37776px; width:452px; height:416px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to ‘look at the river.’ What 
    <br>is called the ‘upper river’ (the two hundred miles between St. Louis and 
    <br>Cairo, where the Ohio comes in) was low; and the Mississippi changes its 
    <br>channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find it necessary to 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats were to lie in 
    <br>port a week; that is, when the water was at a low stage. A deal of this 
    <br>‘looking at the river’ was done by poor fellows who seldom had a berth, 
    <br>and whose only hope of getting one lay in their being always freshly 
    <br>posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes of some reputable 
    <br>pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot’s sudden illness, or some 
    <br>other necessity. And a good many of them constantly ran up and down 
    <br>inspecting the river, not because they ever really hoped to get a berth, 
    <br>but because (they being guests of the boat) it was cheaper to ‘look at the 
    <br>river’ than stay ashore and pay board. In time these fellows grew dainty 
    <br>in their tastes, and only infested boats that had an established reputation 
    <br>for setting good tables. All visiting pilots were useful, for they were 
    <br>always ready and willing, winter or summer, night or day, to go out in 
    <br>the yawl and help buoy the channel or assist the boat’s pilots in any way 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">they could. They were likewise welcome because all pilots are tireless 
    <br>talkers, when gathered together, and as they talk only about the river 
    <br>they are always understood and are always interesting. Your true pilot 
    <br>cares nothing about anything on earth but the river, and his pride in his 
    <br>occupation surpasses the pride of kings.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">were eight or ten; and there was abundance of room for them in our 
    <br>great pilot-house. Two or three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate

    <br>seemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased, without 
    <br>asking so grand a captain’s permission. I took my supper and went 
    <br>immediately to bed, discouraged by my day’s observations and 
    <br>experiences. My late voyage’s note-booking was but a confusion of 
    <br>meaningless names. It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had 
    <br>looked at it in the daytime. I now hoped for respite in sleep; but no, it 
    <br>reveled all through my head till sunrise again, a frantic and tireless 
    <br>nightmare.

    <br>along, taking a good many chances, for we were anxious to ‘get out of the 
    <br>river’ (as getting out to Cairo was called) before night should overtake us. 
    <br>But Mr. Bixby’s partner, the other pilot, presently grounded the boat, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and we lost so much time in getting her off that it was plain that 
    <br>darkness would overtake us a good long way above the mouth. This was a 
    <br>great misfortune, especially to certain of our visiting pilots, whose boats 
    <br>would have to wait for their return, no matter how long that might be. It 
    <br>sobered the pilot-house talk a good deal. Coming up-stream, pilots did 
    <br>not mind low water or any kind of darkness; nothing stopped them but 
    <br>fog. But down-stream work was different; a boat was too nearly helpless, 
    <br>with a stiff current pushing behind her; so it was not customary to run 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">down-stream at night in low water.

    <br>venture the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water. But 
    <br>it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night. So there was a deal of 
    <br>looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant ciphering upon 
    <br>the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal subject; 
    <br>sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a bad 
    <br>crossing, and down it went again. For hours all hands lay under the 
    <br>burden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me, 
    <br>and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such an 
    <br>awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five minutes 
    <br>on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and start over again. We 
    <br>were standing no regular watches. Each of our pilots ran such portions of

    <br>aside. For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand 
    <br>and was restless, silent, and uneasy. At last somebody said, with a 
    <br>doomful sigh— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:40628px; width:454px; height:270px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Well, yonder’s Hat Island—and we can’t make it.’ All the watches closed 
    <br>with a snap, everybody sighed and muttered something about its being 
    <br>‘too bad, too bad—ah, if we could only have got here half an hour 
    <br>sooner!’ and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment. 
    <br>Some started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land. The sun 
    <br>dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on. Inquiring looks passed 
    <br>from one guest to another; and one who had his hand on the door-knob 
    <br>and had turned it, waited, then presently took away his hand and let the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">knob turn back again. We bore steadily down the bend. More looks were 
    <br>exchanged, and nods of surprised admiration—but no words. Insensibly 
    <br>the men drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or 
    <br>two dim stars came out. The dead silence and sense of waiting became 
    <br>oppressive. Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep, mellow notes from 
    <br>the big bell floated off on the night. Then a pause, and one more note was 
    <br>struck. The watchman’s voice followed, from the hurricane deck—

    <br>and it is a weird sound, always, in the night. Every pilot in the lot was 
    <br>watching now, with fixed eyes, and talking under his breath. Nobody was 
    <br>calm and easy but Mr. Bixby. He would put his wheel down and stand on 
    <br>a spoke, and as the steamer swung into her (to me) utterly invisible 
    <br>marks—for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea—he

    <br>current. Not that I could see the boat drift, for I could not, the stars being 
    <br>all gone by this time. This drifting was the dismalest work; it held one’s 
    <br>heart still. Presently I discovered a blacker gloom than that which 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">surrounded us. It was the head of the island. We were closing right down 
    <br>upon it. We entered its deeper shadow, and so imminent seemed the

    <br>do </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">something</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">, anything, to save the vessel. But still Mr. Bixby stood by

    <br>take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those little 
    <br>gaps. But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough to lift 
    <br>my nose a trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of something 
    <br>to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me suddenly with this

    <br>adjectives.

    <br>and the shape of the shores changing like everything. Why, you wouldn’t

    <br>shape. My spirits were down in the mud again. Two things seemed pretty 
    <br>apparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man had got to 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">learn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other 
    <br>was, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every twenty-

    <br>custom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed. While 
    <br>the relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar, his partner, the 
    <br>retiring pilot, would say something like this—

    <br>twain with the lower lead and mark twain {footnote [Two fathoms. 
    <br>‘Quarter twain’ is two-and-a-quarter fathoms, thirteen-and-a-half feet.

    <br>unpardonable sin among pilots. So Mr. Bixby gave him no greeting 
    <br>whatever, but simply surrendered the wheel and marched out of the 
    <br>pilot-house without a word. I was appalled; it was a villainous night for 
    <br>blackness, we were in a particularly wide and blind part of the river, 
    <br>where there was no shape or substance to anything, and it seemed 
    <br>incredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that poor fellow to kill the boat 
    <br>trying to find out where he was. But I resolved that I would stand by him 
    <br>any way. He should find that he was not wholly friendless. So I stood 
    <br>around, and waited to be asked where we were. But Mr. W—— plunged 
    <br>on serenely through the solid firmament of black cats that stood for an 
    <br>atmosphere, and never opened his mouth. Here is a proud devil, thought 
    <br>I; here is a limb of Satan that would rather send us all to destruction than 
    <br>put himself under obligations to me, because I am not yet one of the salt 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the earth and privileged to snub captains and lord it over everything 
    <br>dead and alive in a steamboat. I presently climbed up on the bench; I did 
    <br>not think it was safe to go to sleep while this lunatic was on watch.

    <br>minutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr. 
    <br>Bixby’s system, and then I judge it filled him nearly up to the chin;

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands on, that 
    <br>was the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp, wooded point that

    <br>succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up toward it and the

    <br>bank! If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing upon the very 
    <br>point of the cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into the 
    <br>general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, when I got 
    <br>abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to its shape long enough for 
    <br>me to make up my mind what its form really was, but it was as dissolving 
    <br>and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the hottest corner 
    <br>of the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when I was coming 
    <br>downstream that it had borne when I went up. I mentioned these little

    <br>I can boom right along the way I’m going; but the moment it splits at the

    <br>such a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal water and the

    <br>the same. I never could more than get one knotty thing learned before 
    <br>another presented itself. Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the water 
    <br>and pretending to read it as if it were a book; but it was a book that told 
    <br>me nothing. A time came at last, however, when Mr. Bixby seemed to 
    <br>think me far enough advanced to bear a lesson on water-reading. So he 
    <br>began— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:48534px; width:449px; height:105px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water? Now, that’s a 
    <br>reef. Moreover, it’s a bluff reef. There is a solid sand-bar under it that is 
    <br>nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house. There is plenty of 
    <br>water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it. If you were to hit it you 
    <br>would knock the boat’s brains out. Do you see where the line fringes out 
    <br>at the upper end and begins to fade away?’ 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:48654px; width:57px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Yes, sir.’

    <br>there, and not hurt anything. Cross over, now, and follow along close 
    <br>under the reef—easy water there—not much current.’

    <br>Bixby said— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:48794px; width:441px; height:50px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Now get ready. Wait till I give the word. She won’t want to mount the

    <br>hand. NOW cramp her down! Snatch her! snatch her!’

    <br>was hard down, and then we held it so. The boat resisted, and refused to 
    <br>answer for a while, and next she came surging to starboard, mounted the 
    <br>reef, and sent a long, angry ridge of water foaming away from her bows.

    <br>along, getting prouder and prouder, for he had never left the boat in my

    <br>did not know which end I stood on; I gasped and could not get my 
    <br>breath; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that it wove itself 
    <br>together like a spider’s web; the boat answered and turned square away 
    <br>from the reef, but the reef followed her! I fled, and still it followed, still it 
    <br>kept—right across my bows! I never looked to see where I was going, I

    <br>I committed the crime of ringing a bell, I might get thrown overboard. 
    <br>But better that than kill the boat. So in blind desperation I started such a 
    <br>rattling ‘shivaree’ down below as never had astounded an engineer in 
    <br>this world before, I fancy. Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines 
    <br>began to back and fill in a furious way, and my reason forsook its 
    <br>throne—we were about to crash into the woods on the other side of the

    <br>deck. My soul went out to him in gratitude. My distress vanished; I 
    <br>would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara, with Mr. Bixby on the 
    <br>hurricane deck. He blandly and sweetly took his tooth-pick out of his 
    <br>mouth between his fingers, as if it were a cigar—we were just in the act of 
    <br>climbing an overhanging big tree, and the passengers were scudding

    <br>The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a peculiar sort of 
    <br>faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions when he did not

    <br>indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of the largest capitals, with 
    <br>a string of shouting exclamation points at the end of it; for it meant that 
    <br>a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the 
    <br>strongest vessel that ever floated. It is the faintest and simplest 
    <br>expression the water ever makes, and the most hideous to a pilot’s eye. 
    <br>In truth, the passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all 
    <br>manner of pretty pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the

    <br>gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful 
    <br>sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad 
    <br>expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red 
    <br>hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, 
    <br>black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling 
    <br>upon the water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling 
    <br>rings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and 
    <br>radiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was 
    <br>densely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was 
    <br>broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; and high 
    <br>above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy 
    <br>bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images,

    <br>glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight

    <br>altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I

    <br>nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling ‘boils’ show 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">a dissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in the 
    <br>slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is 
    <br>shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is 
    <br>the ‘break’ from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best 
    <br>place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with 
    <br>a single living branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a body 
    <br>ever going to get through this blind place at night without the friendly 
    <br>old landmark.

    <br>could furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat. Since 
    <br>those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely 
    <br>flush in a beauty’s cheek mean to a doctor but a ‘break’ that ripples above 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what 
    <br>are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever see her 
    <br>beauty at all, or doesn’t he simply view her professionally, and comment 
    <br>upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And doesn’t he 
    <br>sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning 
    <br>his trade?

    <br>preceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting 
    <br>as a science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not 
    <br>quite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and painstaking way, 
    <br>what a wonderful science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted, and 
    <br>therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run them; 
    <br>clear-water rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels very 
    <br>gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but piloting 
    <br>becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like the 
    <br>Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave and change 
    <br>constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and 
    <br>shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all 
    <br>weathers without the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy; for 
    <br>there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this three or 
    <br>four thousand miles of villainous river.{footnote [True at the time 
    <br>referred to; not true now (1882).]} I feel justified in enlarging upon this 
    <br>great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever yet written a 
    <br>paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself, and so had a 
    <br>practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme were hackneyed, I 
    <br>should be obliged to deal gently with the reader; but since it is wholly 
    <br>new, I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable degree of room with 
    <br>it.

    <br>face of the water as one would cull the news from the morning paper; 
    <br>and finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an

    <br>we held the conversation above narrated, we met a great rise coming 
    <br>down the river. The whole vast face of the stream was black with drifting 
    <br>dead logs, broken boughs, and great trees that had caved in and been 
    <br>washed away. It required the nicest steering to pick one’s way through 
    <br>this rushing raft, even in the day-time, when crossing from point to 
    <br>point; and at night the difficulty was mightily increased; every now and 
    <br>then a huge log, lying deep in the water, would suddenly appear right 
    <br>under our bows, coming head-on; no use to try to avoid it then; we could 
    <br>only stop the engines, and one wheel would walk over that log from one 
    <br>end to the other, keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat 
    <br>in a way that was very uncomfortable to passengers. Now and then we 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">would hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang, dead in the center, 
    <br>with a full head of steam, and it would stun the boat as if she had hit a 
    <br>continent. Sometimes this log would lodge, and stay right across our 
    <br>nose, and back the Mississippi up before it; we would have to do a little 
    <br>craw-fishing, then, to get away from the obstruction. We often 
    <br>hit </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">white </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">logs, in the dark, for we could not see them till we were right on 
    <br>them; but a black log is a pretty distinct object at night. A white snag is 
    <br>an ugly customer when the daylight is gone. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:57630px; width:444px; height:197px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Of course, on the great rise, down came a swarm of prodigious timber-
    <br>rafts from the head waters of the Mississippi, coal barges from 
    <br>Pittsburgh, little trading scows from everywhere, and broad-horns from 
    <br>‘Posey County,’ Indiana, freighted with ‘fruit and furniture’—the usual 
    <br>term for describing it, though in plain English the freight thus 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">aggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots bore a mortal hatred 
    <br>to these craft; and it was returned with usury. The law required all such 
    <br>helpless traders to keep a light burning, but it was a law that was often 
    <br>broken. All of a sudden, on a murky night, a light would hop up, right 
    <br>under our bows, almost, and an agonized voice, with the backwoods 
    <br>‘whang’ to it, would wail out—

    <br>send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity, one of our wheels 
    <br>would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar, and down 
    <br>the dead blackness would shut again. And that flatboatman would be 
    <br>sure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat, swearing stoutly that he 
    <br>had a light burning all the time, when in truth his gang had the lantern 
    <br>down below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by, and no watch on 
    <br>deck.

    <br>island) which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase ‘as dark 
    <br>as the inside of a cow,’ we should have eaten up a Posey County family, 
    <br>fruit, furniture, and all, but that they happened to be fiddling down 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">below, and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off, 
    <br>doing no serious damage, unfortunately, but coming so near it that we 
    <br>had good hopes for a moment. These people brought up their lantern, 
    <br>then, of course; and as we backed and filled to get away, the precious 
    <br>family stood in the light of it—both sexes and various ages—and cursed 
    <br>us till everything turned blue. Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through 
    <br>our pilot-house, when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very 
    <br>narrow place.

    <br>cramping up around a bar, while a string of these small-fry rascals were

    <br>couple of miles. Now a skiff would dart away from one of them, and

    <br>would throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If these were picked up 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">without comment, you might notice that now a dozen other skiffs had 
    <br>been drifting down upon us without saying anything. You understand, 
    <br>they had been waiting to see how No. 1 was going to fare. No. 1 making 
    <br>no comment, all the rest would bend to their oars and come on, now; and 
    <br>as fast as they came the clerk would heave over neat bundles of religious 
    <br>tracts, tied to shingles. The amount of hard swearing which twelve 
    <br>packages of religious literature will command when impartially divided 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">up among twelve raftsmen’s crews, who have pulled a heavy skiff two 
    <br>miles on a hot day to get them, is simply incredible.

    <br>time the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were 
    <br>hourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before; we 
    <br>were shaving stumpy shores, like that at the foot of Madrid Bend, which 
    <br>I had always seen avoided before; we were clattering through chutes like 
    <br>that of 82, where the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of timber 
    <br>till our nose was almost at the very spot. Some of these chutes were utter 
    <br>solitudes. The dense, untouched forest overhung both banks of the 
    <br>crooked little crack, and one could believe that human creatures had 
    <br>never intruded there before. The swinging grape-vines, the grassy nooks 
    <br>and vistas glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering creepers waving their 
    <br>red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks, and all the spendthrift 
    <br>richness of the forest foliage, were wasted and thrown away there. The 
    <br>chutes were lovely places to steer in; they were deep, except at the head; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the current was gentle; under the ‘points’ the water was absolutely dead, 
    <br>and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender willow thickets 
    <br>projected you could bury your boat’s broadside in them as you tore 
    <br>along, and then you seemed fairly to fly. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:60222px; width:452px; height:343px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Behind other islands we found wretched little farms, and wretcheder 
    <br>little log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two above 
    <br>the water, with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked, yellow-faced male 
    <br>miserables roosting on the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws in hands, 
    <br>grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips through 
    <br>crevices left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and the few farm-
    <br>animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding at her 
    <br>moorings close at hand. In this flat-boat the family would have to cook 
    <br>and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days (or possibly 
    <br>weeks), until the river should fall two or three feet and let them get back 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to their log-cabin and their chills again—chills being a merciful provision 
    <br>of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take exercise without 
    <br>exertion. And this sort of watery camping out was a thing which these 
    <br>people were rather liable to be treated to a couple of times a year: by the 
    <br>December rise out of the Ohio, and the June rise out of the Mississippi. 
    <br>And yet these were kindly dispensations, for they at least enabled the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">poor things to rise from the dead now and then, and look upon life when 
    <br>a steamboat went by. They appreciated the blessing, too, for they spread 
    <br>their mouths and eyes wide open and made the most of these occasions.

    <br>completely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will serve to show how 
    <br>narrow some of the chutes were. The passengers had an hour’s 
    <br>recreation in a virgin wilderness, while the boat-hands chopped the 
    <br>bridge away; for there was no such thing as turning back, you 
    <br>comprehend.

    <br>particular trouble in the night, for the thousand-mile wall of dense forest 
    <br>that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm or 
    <br>wood-yard opening at intervals, and so you can’t ‘get out of the river’ 
    <br>much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane; but from Baton 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more than a 
    <br>mile wide, and very deep—as much as two hundred feet, in places. Both 
    <br>banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are shorn of their timber 
    <br>and bordered by continuous sugar plantations, with only here and there 
    <br>a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees. The timber is 
    <br>shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations, from two to four miles. 
    <br>When the first frost threatens to come, the planters snatch off their crops 
    <br>in a hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they form the 
    <br>refuse of the stalks (which they call </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">bagasse</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">) into great piles and set fire 
    <br>to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse is used for fuel in 
    <br>the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the piles of damp bagasse burn 
    <br>slowly, and smoke like Satan’s own kitchen.

    <br>embankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten to perhaps a 
    <br>hundred feet, according to circumstances; say thirty or forty feet, as a 
    <br>general thing. Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of 
    <br>smoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles, when the river is 
    <br>over the banks, and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and 
    <br>see how she will feel. And see how you will feel, too! You find yourself 
    <br>away out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades out 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and loses itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern the thin 
    <br>rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you see a straggling

    <br>tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty. You hope you are 
    <br>keeping in the river, but you do not know. All that you are sure about is 
    <br>that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank and destruction, when 
    <br>you think you are a good half-mile from shore. And you are sure, also, 
    <br>that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and 
    <br>topple your chimneys overboard, you will have the small comfort of 
    <br>knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. One of the great 
    <br>Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one night, at such a 
    <br>time, and had to stay there a week. But there was no novelty about it; it 
    <br>had often been done before.

    <br>while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in that it is connected with 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">piloting. There used to be an excellent pilot on the river, a Mr. X., who 
    <br>was a somnambulist. It was said that if his mind was troubled about a 
    <br>bad piece of river, he was pretty sure to get up and walk in his sleep and 
    <br>do strange things. He was once fellow-pilot for a trip or two with George 
    <br>Ealer, on a great New Orleans passenger packet. During a considerable 
    <br>part of the first trip George was uneasy, but got over it by and by, as X. 
    <br>seemed content to stay in his bed when asleep. Late one night the boat 
    <br>was approaching Helena, Arkansas; the water was low, and the crossing 
    <br>above the town in a very blind and tangled condition. X. had seen the 
    <br>crossing since Ealer had, and as the night was particularly drizzly, sullen, 
    <br>and dark, Ealer was considering whether he had not better have X. called 
    <br>to assist in running the place, when the door opened and X. walked in. 
    <br>Now on very dark nights, light is a deadly enemy to piloting; you are 
    <br>aware that if you stand in a lighted room, on such a night, you cannot see 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">things in the street to any purpose; but if you put out the lights and stand 
    <br>in the gloom you can make out objects in the street pretty well. So, on 
    <br>very dark nights, pilots do not smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-
    <br>house stove if there is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape; 
    <br>they order the furnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the sky-
    <br>lights to be closely blinded. Then no light whatever issues from the boat. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The undefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr. X.‘s 
    <br>voice. This said—

    <br>leads; he rang to slow down the steam; he worked the boat carefully and 
    <br>neatly into invisible marks, then stood at the center of the wheel and 
    <br>peered blandly out into the blackness, fore and aft, to verify his position; 
    <br>as the leads shoaled more and more, he stopped the engines entirely, and 
    <br>the dead silence and suspense of ‘drifting’ followed when the shoalest 
    <br>water was struck, he cracked on the steam, carried her handsomely over, 
    <br>and then began to work her warily into the next system of shoal marks; 
    <br>the same patient, heedful use of leads and engines followed, the boat 
    <br>slipped through without touching bottom, and entered upon the third 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and last intricacy of the crossing; imperceptibly she moved through the 
    <br>gloom, crept by inches into her marks, drifted tediously till the shoalest

    <br>water’ there is in the channel,—or a few inches more, as was often the 
    <br>case in the old times,—one must be painfully circumspect in his piloting. 
    <br>We used to have to ‘sound’ a number of particularly bad places almost 
    <br>every trip when the river was at a very low stage. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:64515px; width:454px; height:325px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Sounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the shore, just above 
    <br>the shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch takes his ‘cub’ or steersman 
    <br>and a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer also), and goes out in the 
    <br>yawl—provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury, a 
    <br>regularly-devised ‘sounding-boat’—and proceeds to hunt for the best 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">water, the pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass, 
    <br>meantime, and in some instances assisting by signals of the boat’s 
    <br>whistle, signifying ‘try higher up’ or ‘try lower down;’ for the surface of 
    <br>the water, like an oil-painting, is more expressive and intelligible when 
    <br>inspected from a little distance than very close at hand. The whistle 
    <br>signals are seldom necessary, however; never, perhaps, except when the 
    <br>wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water’s surface. When the 
    <br>yawl has reached the shoal place, the speed is slackened, the pilot begins 
    <br>to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long, and the steersman 
    <br>at the tiller obeys the order to ‘hold her up to starboard;’ or, ‘let her fall 
    <br>off to larboard;’{footnote [The term ‘larboard’ is never used at sea now, 
    <br>to signify the left hand; but was always used on the river in my time]} or 
    <br>‘steady—steady as you go.’

    <br>shoalest part of the reef, the command is given to ‘ease all!’ Then the 
    <br>men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current. The next order is, 
    <br>‘Stand by with the buoy!’ The moment the shallowest point is reached, 
    <br>the pilot delivers the order, ‘Let go the buoy!’ and over she goes. If the 
    <br>pilot is not satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds better water 
    <br>higher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place. Being finally 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand their oars straight up 
    <br>in the air, in line; a blast from the boat’s whistle indicates that the signal 
    <br>has been seen; then the men ‘give way’ on their oars and lay the yawl

    <br>the deep water beyond. Or maybe she doesn’t; maybe she ‘strikes and

    <br>herself off.

    <br>best water, and the steamer follows along in its wake. Often there is a 
    <br>deal of fun and excitement about sounding, especially if it is a glorious 
    <br>summer day, or a blustering night. But in winter the cold and the peril 
    <br>take most of the fun out of it.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">up; it is a reversed school-house bench, with one of the supports left and 
    <br>the other removed. It is anchored on the shoalest part of the reef by a 
    <br>rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it. But for the resistance 
    <br>of the turned-up end of the reversed bench, the current would pull the 
    <br>buoy under water. At night, a paper lantern with a candle in it is fastened 
    <br>on top of the buoy, and this can be seen a mile or more, a little 
    <br>glimmering spark in the waste of blackness.

    <br>There is such an air of adventure about it; often there is danger; it is so 
    <br>gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer a swift 
    <br>yawl; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the boat when 
    <br>an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the oars; it is lovely 
    <br>to see the white foam stream away from the bows; there is music in the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">rush of the water; it is deliciously exhilarating, in summer, to go 
    <br>speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the world of 
    <br>wavelets is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to the cub, to get 
    <br>a chance to give an order; for often the pilot will simply say, ‘Let her go 
    <br>about!’ and leave the rest to the cub, who instantly cries, in his sternest 
    <br>tone of command, ‘Ease starboard! Strong on the larboard! Starboard 
    <br>give way! With a will, men!’ The cub enjoys sounding for the further 
    <br>reason that the eyes of the passengers are watching all the yawl’s 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">movements with absorbing interest if the time be daylight; and if it be 
    <br>night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon the

    <br>contest. About this time something happened which promised 
    <br>handsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head 
    <br>of 21. This would occur about nine or ten o’clock at night, when the 
    <br>passengers would be still up; it would be Mr. Thornburg’s watch, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">therefore my chief would have to do the sounding. We had a perfect love 
    <br>of a sounding-boat—long, trim, graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound; her 
    <br>thwarts were cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; one of the mates 
    <br>was always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew, for ours was a 
    <br>steamer where no end of ‘style’ was put on.

    <br>the river was so wide, there, that a landsman’s uneducated eyes could 
    <br>discern no opposite shore through such a gloom. The passengers were 
    <br>alert and interested; everything was satisfactory. As I hurried through 
    <br>the engine-room, picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery, I met Tom, 
    <br>and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech—

    <br>the unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller, and my chief sitting by him 
    <br>with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool’s errand to fetch. 
    <br>Then that young girl said to me— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:67176px; width:431px; height:32px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night! Do

    <br>pilot-house. By and by the boat’s lantern disappeared, and after an 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">interval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away. 
    <br>Mr. Thornburg blew the whistle, in acknowledgment, backed the steamer 
    <br>out, and made for it. We flew along for a while, then slackened steam and 
    <br>went cautiously gliding toward the spark. Presently Mr. Thornburg 
    <br>exclaimed— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:67361px; width:191px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Hello, the buoy-lantern’s out!’

    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:67418px; width:145px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Why, there it is again!’

    <br>Gradually the water shoaled up, and then began to deepen again! Mr. 
    <br>Thornburg muttered— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:67511px; width:449px; height:50px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Well, I don’t understand this. I believe that buoy has drifted off the reef. 
    <br>Seems to be a little too far to the left. No matter, it is safest to run over it 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">anyhow.’

    <br>Just as our bows were in the act of plowing over it, Mr. Thornburg seized 
    <br>the bell-ropes, rang a startling peal, and exclaimed— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:67641px; width:205px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘My soul, it’s the sounding-boat!’

    <br>mate and nearly all the men were safe. They had discovered their danger 
    <br>when it was too late to pull out of the way; then, when the great guards 
    <br>overshadowed them a moment later, they were prepared and knew what 
    <br>to do; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant, seized the 
    <br>guard, and were hauled aboard. The next moment the sounding-yawl 
    <br>swept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of 
    <br>the men and the cub Tom, were missing—a fact which spread like 
    <br>wildfire over the boat. The passengers came flocking to the forward 
    <br>gangway, ladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, and talked in awed 
    <br>voices of the dreadful thing. And often and again I heard them say, ‘Poor 
    <br>fellows! poor boy, poor boy!’ 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:68186px; width:447px; height:178px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">By this time the boat’s yawl was manned and away, to search for the 
    <br>missing. Now a faint call was heard, off to the left. The yawl had 
    <br>disappeared in the other direction. Half the people rushed to one side to 
    <br>encourage the swimmer with their shouts; the other half rushed the 
    <br>other way to shriek to the yawl to turn about. By the callings, the 
    <br>swimmer was approaching, but some said the sound showed failing 
    <br>strength. The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings, 
    <br>leaning over and staring into the gloom; and every faint and fainter cry 
    <br>wrung from them such words as, ‘Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there 
    <br>no way to save him?’ 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:68379px; width:448px; height:32px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">But still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and presently the voice said 
    <br>pluckily— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:68426px; width:228px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘I can make it! Stand by with a rope!’

    <br>glare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in his hand, and his men grouped 
    <br>about him. The next moment the swimmer’s face appeared in the circle 
    <br>of light, and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard, limp and 
    <br>drenched, while cheer on cheer went up. It was that devil Tom.

    <br>They probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled back, and were struck 
    <br>by the wheel and killed. Tom had never jumped for the guard at all, but

    <br>light was this. My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell away and 
    <br>watched it till it seemed to be secure; then he took up a position a 
    <br>hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the steamer’s course, 
    <br>headed the sounding-boat up-stream, and waited. Having to wait some 
    <br>time, he and the officer got to talking; he looked up when he judged that 
    <br>the steamer was about on the reef; saw that the buoy was gone, but 
    <br>supposed that the steamer had already run over it; he went on with his 
    <br>talk; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on him, but that 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">was the correct thing; it was her business to shave him closely, for 
    <br>convenience in taking him aboard; he was expecting her to sheer off, 
    <br>until the last moment; then it flashed upon him that she was trying to 
    <br>run him down, mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light; so he sang out, 
    <br>‘Stand by to spring for the guard, men!’ and the next instant the jump 
    <br>was made.

    <br>plainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters, some of the 
    <br>peculiar requirements of the science of piloting. First of all, there is one 
    <br>faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has brought it to 
    <br>absolute perfection. Nothing short of perfection will do. That faculty is 
    <br>memory. He cannot stop with merely thinking a thing is so and so; he 
    <br>must know it; for this is eminently one of the ‘exact’ sciences. With what 
    <br>scorn a pilot was looked upon, in the old times, if he ever ventured to 
    <br>deal in that feeble phrase ‘I think,’ instead of the vigorous one ‘I know!’ 
    <br>One cannot easily realize what a tremendous thing it is to know every 
    <br>trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and know it with absolute 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">exactness. If you will take the longest street in New York, and travel up 
    <br>and down it, conning its features patiently until you know every house 
    <br>and window and door and lamp-post and big and little sign by heart, and 
    <br>know them so accurately that you can instantly name the one you are 
    <br>abreast of when you are set down at random in that street in the middle 
    <br>of an inky black night, you will then have a tolerable notion of the 
    <br>amount and the exactness of a pilot’s knowledge who carries the 
    <br>Mississippi River in his head. And then if you will go on until you know 
    <br>every street crossing, the character, size, and position of the crossing-
    <br>stones, and the varying depth of mud in each of those numberless places, 
    <br>you will have some idea of what the pilot must know in order to keep a 
    <br>Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if you will take half of the signs 
    <br>in that long street, and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">change their places</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> once a month, and still 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">manage to know their new positions accurately on dark nights, and keep 
    <br>up with these repeated changes without making any mistakes, you will 
    <br>understand what is required of a pilot’s peerless memory by the fickle 
    <br>Mississippi.

    <br>hour by hour, day by day, and never loses or mislays a single valuable 
    <br>package of them all! Take an instance. Let a leadsman cry, ‘Half twain! 
    <br>half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain!’ until it become as 
    <br>monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation be going on all the 
    <br>time, and the pilot be doing his share of the talking, and no longer 
    <br>consciously listening to the leadsman; and in the midst of this endless 
    <br>string of half twains let a single ‘quarter twain!’ be interjected, without 
    <br>emphasis, and then the half twain cry go on again, just as before: two or 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision the boat’s 
    <br>position in the river when that quarter twain was uttered, and give you 
    <br>such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, and side-marks to guide you, that 
    <br>you ought to be able to take the boat there and put her in that same spot 
    <br>again yourself! The cry of ‘quarter twain’ did not really take his mind 
    <br>from his talk, but his trained faculties instantly photographed the 
    <br>bearings, noted the change of depth, and laid up the important details 
    <br>for future reference without requiring any assistance from him in the 
    <br>matter. If you were walking and talking with a friend, and another friend 
    <br>at your side kept up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a 
    <br>couple of blocks, and then in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, A, 
    <br>A, R, A, A, A, etc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be able to 
    <br>state, two or three weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be 
    <br>able to tell what objects you were passing at the moment it was done. But 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">you could if your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to 
    <br>do that sort of thing mechanically.

    <br>seen each division once in the daytime and once at night, his education 
    <br>was so nearly complete that he took out a ‘daylight’ license; a few trips 
    <br>later he took out a full license, and went to piloting day and night—and

    <br>Southern trade six months. That was thirteen years ago. I made a trip 
    <br>with him. There was five feet in the upper river then; the “Henry Blake”

    <br>would start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly funny 
    <br>anecdote about a dog. He would be ‘so full of laugh’ that he could hardly

    <br>descriptions of weddings and burials that had occurred in it, together 
    <br>with recitals of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry provoked by 
    <br>the same: then this memory would recollect that one of these events 
    <br>occurred during the celebrated ‘hard winter’ of such and such a year, and 
    <br>a minute description of that winter would follow, along with the names 
    <br>of people who were frozen to death, and statistics showing the high 
    <br>figures which pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay would suggest corn 
    <br>and fodder; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses; cows and 
    <br>horses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and natural; 
    <br>from the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a step; then of course the 
    <br>heathen savages would suggest religion; and at the end of three or four 
    <br>hours’ tedious jaw, the watch would change, and Brown would go out of 
    <br>the pilot-house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years 
    <br>before about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace. And the original 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">first mention would be all you had learned about that dog, after all this

    <br>must also have. He must have good and quick judgment and decision, 
    <br>and a cool, calm courage that no peril can shake. Give a man the merest 
    <br>trifle of pluck to start with, and by the time he has become a pilot he 
    <br>cannot be unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into; but one 
    <br>cannot quite say the same for judgment. Judgment is a matter of brains, 
    <br>and a man must </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">start </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">with a good stock of that article or he will never 
    <br>succeed as a pilot. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:73418px; width:453px; height:288px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time, but it 
    <br>does not reach a high and satisfactory condition until some time after the 
    <br>young pilot has been ‘standing his own watch,’ alone and under the 
    <br>staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the position. 
    <br>When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with the 
    <br>river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his steamboat, night or 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">day, that he presently begins to imagine that it is </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">his </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">courage that 
    <br>animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out and leaves him to his 
    <br>own devices he finds out it was the other man’s. He discovers that the 
    <br>article has been left out of his own cargo altogether. The whole river is 
    <br>bristling with exigencies in a moment; he is not prepared for them; he 
    <br>does not know how to meet them; all his knowledge forsakes him; and 
    <br>within fifteen minutes he is as white as a sheet and scared almost to 
    <br>death. Therefore pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks 
    <br>to look danger in the face a little more calmly. A favorite way of theirs is 
    <br>to play a friendly swindle upon the candidate.

    <br>of leisure nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river 
    <br>was about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any

    <br>somebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to 
    <br>the leadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the 
    <br>officers, and then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack 
    <br>where he could observe results. Presently the captain stepped out on the 
    <br>hurricane deck; next the chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every 
    <br>moment or two a straggler was added to my audience; and before I got to 
    <br>the head of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down 
    <br>there under my nose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I 
    <br>started across, the captain glanced aloft at me and said, with a sham 
    <br>uneasiness in his voice—

    <br>science of piloting, to carry the reader step by step to a comprehension of 
    <br>what the science consists of; and at the same time I have tried to show 
    <br>him that it is a very curious and wonderful science, too, and very worthy 
    <br>of his attention. If I have seemed to love my subject, it is no surprising 
    <br>thing, for I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since, 
    <br>and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is plain: a pilot, in those 
    <br>days, was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being 
    <br>that lived in the earth. Kings are but the hampered servants of 
    <br>parliament and people; parliaments sit in chains forged by their 
    <br>constituency; the editor of a newspaper cannot be independent, but must 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">work with one hand tied behind him by party and patrons, and be 
    <br>content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind; no clergyman is a 
    <br>free man and may speak the whole truth, regardless of his parish’s 
    <br>opinions; writers of all kinds are manacled servants of the public. We 
    <br>write frankly and fearlessly, but then we ‘modify’ before we print. In 
    <br>truth, every man and woman and child has a master, and worries and 
    <br>frets in servitude; but in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot had 
    <br>none. The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp of a 
    <br>very brief authority, and give him five or six orders while the vessel 
    <br>backed into the stream, and then that skipper’s reign was over. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:77295px; width:454px; height:215px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The moment that the boat was under way in the river, she was under the 
    <br>sole and unquestioned control of the pilot. He could do with her exactly 
    <br>as he pleased, run her when and whither he chose, and tie her up to the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">bank whenever his judgment said that that course was best. His 
    <br>movements were entirely free; he consulted no one, he received 
    <br>commands from nobody, he promptly resented even the merest 
    <br>suggestions. Indeed, the law of the United States forbade him to listen to 
    <br>commands or suggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily 
    <br>knew better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him. So here 
    <br>was the novelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch who was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words. I have seen a boy of 
    <br>eighteen taking a great steamer serenely into what seemed almost

    <br>apprehension but powerless to interfere. His interference, in that 
    <br>particular instance, might have been an excellent thing, but to permit it 
    <br>would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent. It will easily 
    <br>be guessed, considering the pilot’s boundless authority, that he was a 
    <br>great personage in the old steamboating days. He was treated with 
    <br>marked courtesy by the captain and with marked deference by all the 
    <br>officers and servants; and this deferential spirit was quickly 
    <br>communicated to the passengers, too. I think pilots were about the only 
    <br>people I ever knew who failed to show, in some degree, embarrassment 
    <br>in the presence of traveling foreign princes. But then, people in one’s 
    <br>own grade of life are not usually embarrassing objects.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of a request, instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order. In 
    <br>those old days, to load a steamboat at St. Louis, take her to New Orleans 
    <br>and back, and discharge cargo, consumed about twenty-five days, on an 
    <br>average. Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the wharves of St. 
    <br>Louis and New Orleans, and every soul on board was hard at work, 
    <br>except the two pilots; they did nothing but play gentleman up town, and 
    <br>receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty. The moment 
    <br>the boat touched the wharf at either city, they were ashore; and they 
    <br>were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and 
    <br>everything in readiness for another voyage.

    <br>pains to keep him. When wages were four hundred dollars a month on 
    <br>the Upper Mississippi, I have known a captain to keep such a pilot in 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">idleness, under full pay, three months at a time, while the river was 
    <br>frozen up. And one must remember that in those cheap times four 
    <br>hundred dollars was a salary of almost inconceivable splendor. Few men 
    <br>on shore got such pay as that, and when they did they were mightily 
    <br>looked up to. When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our 
    <br>small Missouri village, they were sought by the best and the fairest, and 
    <br>treated with exalted respect. Lying in port under wages was a thing 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">which many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated; especially if they 
    <br>belonged in the Missouri River in the heyday of that trade (Kansas 
    <br>times), and got nine hundred dollars a trip, which was equivalent to

    <br>in landsmen’s eyes (and in their own, too, in a degree) according to the

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the crew of such stately craft as the ‘Aleck Scott’ or the ‘Grand Turk.’ 
    <br>Negro firemen, deck hands, and barbers belonging to those boats were 
    <br>distinguished personages in their grade of life, and they were well aware 
    <br>of that fact too. A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro ball in 
    <br>New Orleans by putting on a good many airs. Finally one of the 
    <br>managers bustled up to him and said—

    <br>importance with balmy complacency, and was greatly courted by the 
    <br>circle in which he moved. The young colored population of New Orleans 
    <br>were much given to flirting, at twilight, on the banquettes of the back 
    <br>streets. Somebody saw and heard something like the following, one

    <br>position placed him out of the reach of criticism or command, brings 
    <br>Stephen W—— naturally to my mind. He was a gifted pilot, a good fellow, 
    <br>a tireless talker, and had both wit and humor in him. He had a most 
    <br>irreverent independence, too, and was deliciously easy-going and 
    <br>comfortable in the presence of age, official dignity, and even the most 
    <br>august wealth. He always had work, he never saved a penny, he was a 
    <br>most persuasive borrower, he was in debt to every pilot on the river, and 
    <br>to the majority of the captains. He could throw a sort of splendor around 
    <br>a bit of harum-scarum, devil-may-care piloting, that made it almost 
    <br>fascinating—but not to everybody. He made a trip with good old Captain 
    <br>Y——once, and was ‘relieved’ from duty when the boat got to New 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Orleans. Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge. Captain Y—— 
    <br>shuddered at the mere mention of Stephen. Then his poor, thin old voice 
    <br>piped out something like this:— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:79836px; width:453px; height:361px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘Why, bless me! I wouldn’t have such a wild creature on my boat for the 
    <br>world—not for the whole world! He swears, he sings, he whistles, he 
    <br>yells—I never saw such an Injun to yell. All times of the night—it never 
    <br>made any difference to him. He would just yell that way, not for anything 
    <br>in particular, but merely on account of a kind of devilish comfort he got 
    <br>out of it. I never could get into a sound sleep but he would fetch me out 
    <br>of bed, all in a cold sweat, with one of those dreadful war-whoops. A 
    <br>queer being—very queer being; no respect for anything or anybody. 
    <br>Sometimes he called me “Johnny.” And he kept a fiddle, and a cat. He 
    <br>played execrably. This seemed to distress the cat, and so the cat would 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">howl. Nobody could sleep where that man—and his family—was. And 
    <br>reckless. There never was anything like it. Now you may believe it or not, 
    <br>but as sure as I am sitting here, he brought my boat a-tilting down 
    <br>through those awful snags at Chicot under a rattling head of steam, and 
    <br>the wind a-blowing like the very nation, at that! My officers will tell you 
    <br>so. They saw it. And, sir, while he was a-tearing right down through 
    <br>those snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying, I wish I may never 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">speak again if he didn’t pucker up his mouth and go to </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">whistling</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">! Yes, 
    <br>sir; whistling “Buffalo gals, can’t you come out tonight, can’t you come

    <br>and as usual out of money. He laid steady siege to Stephen, who was in a 
    <br>very ‘close place,’ and finally persuaded him to hire with him at one 
    <br>hundred and twenty-five dollars per month, just half wages, the captain 
    <br>agreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt of all 
    <br>the guild upon the poor fellow. But the boat was not more than a day out 
    <br>of New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting 
    <br>of his exploit, and that all the officers had been told. Stephen winced, but 
    <br>said nothing. About the middle of the afternoon the captain stepped out 
    <br>on the hurricane deck, cast his eye around, and looked a good deal 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">surprised. He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen, but Stephen was 
    <br>whistling placidly, and attending to business. The captain stood around a 
    <br>while in evident discomfort, and once or twice seemed about to make a 
    <br>suggestion; but the etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort of 
    <br>rashness, and so he managed to hold his peace. He chafed and puzzled a 
    <br>few minutes longer, then retired to his apartments. But soon he was out 
    <br>again, and apparently more perplexed than ever. Presently he ventured 
    <br>to remark, with deference—

    <br>organization which the pilots once formed for the protection of their

    <br>ever formed among men.

    <br>the wages began to fall little by little. It was easy to discover the reason of

    <br>steersman, to do all the hard work for a couple of years, gratis, while his 
    <br>master sat on a high bench and smoked; all pilots and captains had sons 
    <br>or nephews who wanted to be pilots. By and by it came to pass that 
    <br>nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a steersman had

    <br>undermine the wages, in order to get berths. Too late—apparently—the 
    <br>knights of the tiller perceived their mistake. Plainly, something had to be 
    <br>done, and quickly; but what was to be the needful thing. A close 
    <br>organization. Nothing else would answer. To compass this seemed an 
    <br>impossibility; so it was talked, and talked, and then dropped. It was too 
    <br>likely to ruin whoever ventured to move in the matter. But at last about a 
    <br>dozen of the boldest—and some of them the best—pilots on the river 
    <br>launched themselves into the enterprise and took all the chances. They 
    <br>got a special charter from the legislature, with large powers, under the 
    <br>name of the Pilots’ Benevolent Association; elected their officers, 
    <br>completed their organization, contributed capital, put ‘association’ wages 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">up to two hundred and fifty dollars at once—and then retired to their 
    <br>homes, for they were promptly discharged from employment. But there 
    <br>were two or three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds 
    <br>of propagation in them. For instance, all idle members of the association, 
    <br>in good standing, were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per 
    <br>month. This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks 
    <br>of the new-fledged pilots, in the dull (summer) season. Better have 
    <br>twenty-five dollars than starve; the initiation fee was only twelve dollars, 
    <br>and no dues required from the unemployed.

    <br>twenty-five dollars per month, and a certain sum for each of their 
    <br>children. Also, the said deceased would be buried at the association’s 
    <br>expense. These things resurrected all the superannuated and forgotten 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">pilots in the Mississippi Valley. They came from farms, they came from 
    <br>interior villages, they came from everywhere. They came on crutches, on 
    <br>drays, in ambulances,—any way, so they got there. They paid in their 
    <br>twelve dollars, and straightway began to draw out twenty-five dollars a 
    <br>month, and calculate their burial bills.

    <br>whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed, and no one would 
    <br>employ them. Everybody was derisively grateful to the association for 
    <br>taking all the worthless pilots out of the way and leaving the whole field 
    <br>to the excellent and the deserving; and everybody was not only jocularly 
    <br>grateful for that, but for a result which naturally followed, namely, the 
    <br>gradual advance of wages as the busy season approached. Wages had 
    <br>gone up from the low figure of one hundred dollars a month to one 
    <br>hundred and twenty-five, and in some cases to one hundred and fifty; 
    <br>and it was great fun to enlarge upon the fact that this charming thing had 
    <br>been accomplished by a body of men not one of whom received a particle 
    <br>of benefit from it. Some of the jokers used to call at the association 
    <br>rooms and have a good time chaffing the members and offering them the 
    <br>charity of taking them as steersmen for a trip, so that they could see what 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the forgotten river looked like. However, the association was content; or 
    <br>at least it gave no sign to the contrary. Now and then it captured a pilot 
    <br>who was ‘out of luck,’ and added him to its list; and these later additions 
    <br>were very valuable, for they were good pilots; the incompetent ones had 
    <br>all been absorbed before. As business freshened, wages climbed 
    <br>gradually up to two hundred and fifty dollars—the association figure—
    <br>and became firmly fixed there; and still without benefiting a member of 
    <br>that body, for no member was hired. The hilarity at the association’s 
    <br>expense burst all bounds, now. There was no end to the fun which that 
    <br>poor martyr had to put up with.

    <br>business doubled and trebled, and an avalanche of Missouri, Illinois and 
    <br>Upper Mississippi River boats came pouring down to take a chance in 
    <br>the New Orleans trade. All of a sudden pilots were in great demand, and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">were correspondingly scarce. The time for revenge was come. It was a 
    <br>bitter pill to have to accept association pilots at last, yet captains and 
    <br>owners agreed that there was no other way. But none of these outcasts 
    <br>offered! So there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed: they must be 
    <br>sought out and asked for their services. Captain —— was the first man 
    <br>who found it necessary to take the dose, and he had been the loudest 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">derider of the organization. He hunted up one of the best of the 
    <br>association pilots and said—

    <br>a hated association man in his berth. In a very little while, idle non-
    <br>associationists began to be pretty plenty, brisk as business was, and 
    <br>much as their services were desired. The laugh was shifting to the other 
    <br>side of their mouths most palpably. These victims, together with the 
    <br>captains and owners, presently ceased to laugh altogether, and began to 
    <br>rage about the revenge they would take when the passing business ‘spurt’ 
    <br>was over. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:85923px; width:451px; height:453px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Soon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews of boats 
    <br>that had two non-association pilots. But their triumph was not very long-
    <br>lived. For this reason: It was a rigid rule of the association that its 
    <br>members should never, under any circumstances whatever, give 
    <br>information about the channel to any ‘outsider.’ By this time about half 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the boats had none but association pilots, and the other half had none 
    <br>but outsiders. At the first glance one would suppose that when it came to 
    <br>forbidding information about the river these two parties could play 
    <br>equally at that game; but this was not so. At every good-sized town from 
    <br>one end of the river to the other, there was a ‘wharf-boat’ to land at, 
    <br>instead of a wharf or a pier. Freight was stored in it for transportation; 
    <br>waiting passengers slept in its cabins. Upon each of these wharf-boats 
    <br>the association’s officers placed a strong box fastened with a peculiar 
    <br>lock which was used in no other service but one—the United States mail 
    <br>service. It was the letter-bag lock, a sacred governmental thing. By dint 
    <br>of much beseeching the government had been persuaded to allow the 
    <br>association to use this lock. Every association man carried a key which 
    <br>would open these boxes. That key, or rather a peculiar way of holding it 
    <br>in the hand when its owner was asked for river information by a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">stranger—for the success of the St. Louis and New Orleans association 
    <br>had now bred tolerably thriving branches in a dozen neighboring 
    <br>steamboat trades—was the association man’s sign and diploma of 
    <br>membership; and if the stranger did not respond by producing a similar 
    <br>key and holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed, his question was 
    <br>politely ignored.

    <br>details of every crossing all the way down from St. Louis) took out and 
    <br>read half a dozen fresh reports (from upward-bound steamers) 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">concerning the river between Cairo and Memphis, posted himself

    <br>into trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his aid.

    <br>or thirteen hundred miles long, whose channel was shifting every day! 
    <br>The pilot who had formerly been obliged to put up with seeing a shoal 
    <br>place once or possibly twice a month, had a hundred sharp eyes to watch 
    <br>it for him, now, and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to run it. 
    <br>His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours old. If the 
    <br>reports in the last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his mind 
    <br>concerning a treacherous crossing, he had his remedy; he blew his 
    <br>steam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat’s pilots were 
    <br>association men; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and all 
    <br>uncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished to the 
    <br>inquirer by word of mouth and in minute detail.

    <br>to take his final and elaborate report to the association parlors and hang

    <br>Other craftsmen can ‘sink the shop,’ sometimes, and interest themselves 
    <br>in other matters. Not so with a pilot; he must devote himself wholly to 
    <br>his profession and talk of nothing else; for it would be small gain to be 
    <br>perfect one day and imperfect the next. He has no time or words to waste 
    <br>if he would keep ‘posted.’

    <br>exchange information, no wharf-boat reports, none but chance and 
    <br>unsatisfactory ways of getting news. The consequence was that a man 
    <br>sometimes had to run five hundred miles of river on information that 
    <br>was a week or ten days old. At a fair stage of the river that might have 
    <br>answered; but when the dead low water came it was destructive.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">ground steamboats, sink them, and get into all sorts of trouble, whereas 
    <br>accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the association men. 
    <br>Wherefore even the owners and captains of boats furnished exclusively 
    <br>with outsiders, and previously considered to be wholly independent of 
    <br>the association and free to comfort themselves with brag and laughter, 
    <br>began to feel pretty uncomfortable. Still, they made a show of keeping up 
    <br>the brag, until one black day when every captain of the lot was formally 
    <br>ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take association 
    <br>pilots in their stead. And who was it that had the dashing presumption to 
    <br>do that? Alas, it came from a power behind the throne that was greater 
    <br>than the throne itself. It was the underwriters!

    <br>ashore at once. Of course it was supposed that there was collusion 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">between the association and the underwriters, but this was not so. The 
    <br>latter had come to comprehend the excellence of the ‘report’ system of 
    <br>the association and the safety it secured, and so they had made their 
    <br>decision among themselves and upon plain business principles.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership. They were

    <br>many cases this amounted to three or four hundred dollars. Still, the 
    <br>association would not entertain the application until the money was 
    <br>present. Even then a single adverse vote killed the application. Every 
    <br>member had to vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ in person and before witnesses; so it 
    <br>took weeks to decide a candidacy, because many pilots were so long 
    <br>absent on voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped their savings 
    <br>together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process, they were added 
    <br>to the fold. A time came, at last, when only about ten remained outside. 
    <br>They said they would starve before they would apply. They remained idle 
    <br>a long while, because of course nobody could venture to employ them.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">associations had grown strong, now, and the Red River one had 
    <br>advanced wages to seven hundred dollars a month. Reluctantly the ten 
    <br>outsiders yielded, in view of these things, and made application. There 
    <br>was another new by-law, by this time, which required them to pay dues 
    <br>not only on all the wages they had received since the association was 
    <br>born, but also on what they would have received if they had continued at 
    <br>work up to the time of their application, instead of going off to pout in 
    <br>idleness. It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them, but it was 
    <br>accomplished at last. The most virulent sinner of this batch had stayed 
    <br>out and allowed ‘dues’ to accumulate against him so long that he had to 
    <br>send in six hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application.

    <br>a limited number would be taken, not by individuals, but by the

    <br>eighteen years old, and of respectable family and good character; he 
    <br>must pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars in

    <br>the world. By the United States law, no man could become a pilot unless 
    <br>two duly licensed pilots signed his application; and now there was 
    <br>nobody outside of the association competent to sign. Consequently the 
    <br>making of pilots was at an end. Every year some would die and others 
    <br>become incapacitated by age and infirmity; there would be no new ones 
    <br>to take their places. In time, the association could put wages up to any 
    <br>figure it chose; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry the 
    <br>thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">association and absolute power; and at last this one was removed. 
    <br>Incredible as it may seem, the owners and captains deliberately did it 
    <br>themselves. When the pilots’ association announced, months 
    <br>beforehand, that on the first day of September, 1861, wages would be 
    <br>advanced to five hundred dollars per month, the owners and captains 
    <br>instantly put freights up a few cents, and explained to the farmers along 
    <br>the river the necessity of it, by calling their attention to the burdensome 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">rate of wages about to be established. It was a rather slender argument, 
    <br>but the farmers did not seem to detect it. It looked reasonable to them 
    <br>that to add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was justifiable under the

    <br>thousand sacks was a good deal more than necessary to cover the new 
    <br>wages. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:90273px; width:454px; height:270px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">So, straightway the captains and owners got up an association of their 
    <br>own, and proposed to put captains’ wages up to five hundred dollars, too, 
    <br>and move for another advance in freights. It was a novel idea, but of 
    <br>course an effect which had been produced once could be produced again. 
    <br>The new association decreed (for this was before all the outsiders had 
    <br>been taken into the pilots’ association) that if any captain employed a 
    <br>non-association pilot, he should be forced to discharge him, and also pay 
    <br>a fine of five hundred dollars. Several of these heavy fines were paid 
    <br>before the captains’ organization grew strong enough to exercise full 
    <br>authority over its membership; but that all ceased, presently. The 
    <br>captains tried to get the pilots to decree that no member of their 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">corporation should serve under a non-association captain; but this 
    <br>proposition was declined. The pilots saw that they would be backed up 
    <br>by the captains and the underwriters anyhow, and so they wisely 
    <br>refrained from entering into entangling alliances. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:90558px; width:450px; height:288px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">As I have remarked, the pilots’ association was now the compactest 
    <br>monopoly in the world, perhaps, and seemed simply indestructible. And 
    <br>yet the days of its glory were numbered. First, the new railroad 
    <br>stretching up through Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to 
    <br>Northern railway centers, began to divert the passenger travel from the 
    <br>steamers; next the war came and almost entirely annihilated the 
    <br>steamboating industry during several years, leaving most of the pilots 
    <br>idle, and the cost of living advancing all the time; then the treasurer of 
    <br>the St. Louis association put his hand into the till and walked off with 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">every dollar of the ample fund; and finally, the railroads intruding 
    <br>everywhere, there was little for steamers to do, when the war was over, 
    <br>but carry freights; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast 
    <br>introduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New 
    <br>Orleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat; and behold, in the twinkling 
    <br>of an eye, as it were, the association and the noble science of piloting 
    <br>were things of the dead and pathetic past!

    <br>four and five o’clock in the afternoon. From three o’clock onward they 
    <br>would be burning rosin and pitch pine (the sign of preparation), and so 
    <br>one had the picturesque spectacle of a rank, some two or three miles 
    <br>long, of tall, ascending columns of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which 
    <br>supported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and 
    <br>spreading abroad over the city. Every outward-bound boat had its flag 
    <br>flying at the jack-staff, and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff 
    <br>astern. Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing 
    <br>with more than usual emphasis; countless processions of freight barrels 
    <br>and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">planks, belated passengers were dodging and skipping among these 
    <br>frantic things, hoping to reach the forecastle companion way alive, but 
    <br>having their doubts about it; women with reticules and bandboxes were 
    <br>trying to keep up with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying 
    <br>babies, and making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and 
    <br>roar and general distraction; drays and baggage-vans were clattering 
    <br>hither and thither in a wild hurry, every now and then getting blocked 
    <br>and jammed together, and then during ten seconds one could not see 
    <br>them for the profanity, except vaguely and dimly; every windlass 
    <br>connected with every forehatch, from one end of that long array of 
    <br>steamboats to the other, was keeping up a deafening whiz and whir, 
    <br>lowering freight into the hold, and the half-naked crews of perspiring 
    <br>negroes that worked them were roaring such songs as ‘De Las’ Sack! De 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Las’ Sack!’—inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of turmoil 
    <br>and racket that was driving everybody else mad.

    <br>packed and black with passengers. The ‘last bells’ would begin to clang, 
    <br>all down the line, and then the powwow seemed to double; in a moment 
    <br>or two the final warning came,—a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, 
    <br>with the cry, ‘All dat ain’t goin’, please to git asho’!’—and behold, the

    <br>gaps in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens crowd the decks of boats 
    <br>that are not to go, in order to see the sight. Steamer after steamer 
    <br>straightens herself up, gathers all her strength, and presently comes 
    <br>swinging by, under a tremendous head of steam, with flag flying, black 
    <br>smoke rolling, and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands (usually 
    <br>swarthy negroes) massed together on the forecastle, the best ‘voice’ in 
    <br>the lot towering from the midst (being mounted on the capstan), waving 
    <br>his hat or a flag, and all roaring a mighty chorus, while the parting 
    <br>cannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">huzza! Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the stately procession

    <br>crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to hear the crews sing, 
    <br>especially if the time were night-fall, and the forecastle lit up with the red 
    <br>glare of the torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun. The public always had 
    <br>an idea that racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite was the case—
    <br>that is, after the laws were passed which restricted each boat to just so 
    <br>many pounds of steam to the square inch. No engineer was ever sleepy 
    <br>or careless when his heart was in a race. He was constantly on the alert, 
    <br>trying gauge-cocks and watching things. The dangerous place was on 
    <br>slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed around and allowed 
    <br>chips to get into the ‘doctor’ and shut off the water supply from the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">boilers.

    <br>steamers was an event of vast importance. The date was set for it several 
    <br>weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole Mississippi 
    <br>Valley was in a state of consuming excitement. Politics and the weather 
    <br>were dropped, and people talked only of the coming race. As the time 
    <br>approached, the two steamers ‘stripped’ and got ready. Every 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">encumbrance that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind 
    <br>or water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. The

    <br>and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground. When 
    <br>the ‘Eclipse’ and the ‘A. L. Shotwell’ ran their great race many years ago, 
    <br>it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the fanciful 
    <br>device which hung between the ‘Eclipse’s’ chimneys, and that for that 
    <br>one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head shaved. But I

    <br>after that. Hardly any passengers were taken, because they not only add 
    <br>weight but they never will ‘trim boat.’ They always run to the side when 
    <br>there is anything to see, whereas a conscientious and experienced 
    <br>steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part his hair in

    <br>these were kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment’s

    <br>boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in. 
    <br>But of course this was at rare intervals. Ferryboats used to lose valuable 
    <br>trips because their passengers grew old and died, waiting for us to get by. 
    <br>This was at still rarer intervals. I had the documents for these 
    <br>occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid. This boat, 
    <br>the ‘John J. Roe,’ was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend, 
    <br>it was five years before the owners heard of it. That was always a 
    <br>confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any way. She was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times racing with 
    <br>islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip, however, we did rather well. 
    <br>We went to St. Louis in sixteen days. But even at this rattling gait I think 
    <br>we changed watches three times in Fort Adams reach, which is five miles 
    <br>long. A ‘reach’ is a piece of straight river, and of course the current drives 
    <br>through such a place in a pretty lively way.

    <br>Cairo in three days, six hours, and forty-four minutes. In 1853 the 
    <br>‘Eclipse’ made the same trip in three days, three hours, and twenty 
    <br>minutes.{footnote [Time disputed. Some authorities add 1 hour and 16 
    <br>minutes to this.]} In 1870 the ‘R. E. Lee’ did it in three days 
    <br>and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">one</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> hour. This last is called the fastest trip on record. I will try to 
    <br>show that it was not. For this reason: the distance between New Orleans 
    <br>and Cairo, when the ‘J. M. White’ ran it, was about eleven hundred and 
    <br>six miles; consequently her average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles 
    <br>per hour. In the ‘Eclipse’s’ day the distance between the two ports had 
    <br>become reduced to one thousand and eighty miles; consequently her 
    <br>average speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per 
    <br>hour. In the ‘R. E. Lee’s’ time the distance had diminished to about one 
    <br>thousand and thirty miles; consequently her average was about fourteen 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and one-eighth miles per hour. Therefore the ‘Eclipse’s’ was 
    <br>conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made.

    <br>opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi’s oddest 
    <br>peculiarities,—that of shortening its length from time to time. If you will 
    <br>throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will pretty fairly 
    <br>shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River; that is, the 
    <br>nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to 
    <br>New Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked, with a brief straight 
    <br>bit here and there at wide intervals. The two hundred-mile stretch from 
    <br>Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so crooked, that being a 
    <br>rocky country which the river cannot cut much. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:95824px; width:453px; height:343px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The water cuts the alluvial banks of the ‘lower’ river into deep horseshoe 
    <br>curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places if you were to get ashore at 
    <br>one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck, half or three 
    <br>quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple of hours while 
    <br>your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed of ten miles 
    <br>an hour, to take you aboard again. When the river is rising fast, some 
    <br>scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country, and therefore of 
    <br>inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little gutter across the 
    <br>narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the water into it, and in a 
    <br>wonderfully short time a miracle has happened: to wit, the whole 
    <br>Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch, and placed the 
    <br>countryman’s plantation on its bank (quadrupling its value), and that 
    <br>other party’s formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on 
    <br>a big island; the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up, boats 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">cannot approach within ten miles of it, and down goes its value to a 
    <br>fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those narrow necks, at 
    <br>needful times, and if a man happens to be caught cutting a ditch across 
    <br>them, the chances are all against his ever having another opportunity to 
    <br>cut a ditch.

    <br>darted through that neck, deserted its old bed, and thus shortened itself 
    <br>thirty-five miles. In the same way it shortened itself twenty-five miles at 
    <br>Black Hawk Point in 1699. Below Red River Landing, Raccourci cut-off 
    <br>was made (forty or fifty years ago, I think). This shortened the river 
    <br>twenty-eight miles. In our day, if you travel by river from the 
    <br>southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost, you go only 
    <br>seventy miles. To do the same thing a hundred and seventy-six years ago, 
    <br>one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight miles!—shortening of eighty-
    <br>eight miles in that trifling distance. At some forgotten time in the past, 
    <br>cut-offs were made above Vidalia, Louisiana; at island 92; at island 84;

    <br>and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be

    <br>speaking of, it is time for the people thereabouts to move. The water 
    <br>cleaves the banks away like a knife. By the time the ditch has become 
    <br>twelve or fifteen feet wide, the calamity is as good as accomplished, for 
    <br>no power on earth can stop it now. When the width has reached a 
    <br>hundred yards, the banks begin to peel off in slices half an acre wide. The 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">current flowing around the bend traveled formerly only five miles an 
    <br>hour; now it is tremendously increased by the shortening of the distance. 
    <br>I was on board the first boat that tried to go through the cut-off at 
    <br>American Bend, but we did not get through. It was toward midnight, and 
    <br>a wild night it was—thunder, lightning, and torrents of rain. It was 
    <br>estimated that the current in the cut-off was making about fifteen or 
    <br>twenty miles an hour; twelve or thirteen was the best our boat could do, 
    <br>even in tolerably slack water, therefore perhaps we were foolish to try the 
    <br>cut-off. However, Mr. Brown was ambitious, and he kept on trying. The 
    <br>eddy running up the bank, under the ‘point,’ was about as swift as the 
    <br>current out in the middle; so we would go flying up the shore like a 
    <br>lightning express train, get on a big head of steam, and ‘stand by for a 
    <br>surge’ when we struck the current that was whirling by the point. But all 
    <br>our preparations were useless. The instant the current hit us it spun us 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">around like a top, the water deluged the forecastle, and the boat 
    <br>careened so far over that one could hardly keep his feet. The next instant 
    <br>we were away down the river, clawing with might and main to keep out 
    <br>of the woods. We tried the experiment four times. I stood on the 
    <br>forecastle companion way to see. It was astonishing to observe how 
    <br>suddenly the boat would spin around and turn tail the moment she 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">emerged from the eddy and the current struck her nose. The sounding 
    <br>concussion and the quivering would have been about the same if she had 
    <br>come full speed against a sand-bank. Under the lightning flashes one

    <br>river; and the crash they made was not a bad effort at thunder. Once, 
    <br>when we spun around, we only missed a house about twenty feet, that 
    <br>had a light burning in the window; and in the same instant that house 
    <br>went overboard. Nobody could stay on our forecastle; the water swept 
    <br>across it in a torrent every time we plunged athwart the current. At the 
    <br>end of our fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles below the 
    <br>cut-off; all the country there was overflowed, of course. A day or two 
    <br>later the cut-off was three-quarters of a mile wide, and boats passed up 
    <br>through it without much difficulty, and so saved ten miles.

    <br>There used to be a tradition connected with it. It was said that a boat 
    <br>came along there in the night and went around the enormous elbow the 
    <br>usual way, the pilots not knowing that the cut-off had been made. It was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">a grisly, hideous night, and all shapes were vague and distorted. The old 
    <br>bend had already begun to fill up, and the boat got to running away from 
    <br>mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting one. The perplexed pilots fell 
    <br>to swearing, and finally uttered the entirely unnecessary wish that they 
    <br>might never get out of that place. As always happens in such cases, that 
    <br>particular prayer was answered, and the others neglected. So to this day 
    <br>that phantom steamer is still butting around in that deserted river, trying 
    <br>to find her way out. More than one grave watchman has sworn to me that 
    <br>on drizzly, dismal nights, he has glanced fearfully down that forgotten 
    <br>river as he passed the head of the island, and seen the faint glow of the 
    <br>specter steamer’s lights drifting through the distant gloom, and heard 
    <br>the muffled cough of her ‘scape-pipes and the plaintive cry of her 
    <br>leadsmen.

    <br>ranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward. Stephen never paid 
    <br>one of these notes, but he was very prompt and very zealous about 
    <br>renewing them every twelve months.

    <br>this one does, with a Y). Young Yates graduated as a pilot, got a berth, 
    <br>and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk’s office 
    <br>and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills, Stephen 
    <br>was there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very little while 
    <br>Yates’s two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands. The fact was 
    <br>soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and satisfaction 
    <br>of the old creditors were large and generous. But innocent Yates never 
    <br>suspected that Stephen’s promise to pay promptly at the end of the week 
    <br>was a worthless one. Yates called for his money at the stipulated time; 
    <br>Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week. He called then, 
    <br>according to agreement, and came away sugar-coated again, but 
    <br>suffering under another postponement. So the thing went on. Yates 
    <br>haunted Stephen week after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it up. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates 
    <br>appeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but 
    <br>beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to 
    <br>pay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming, he would turn and 
    <br>fly, and drag his company with him, if he had company; but it was of no 
    <br>use; his debtor would run him down and corner him. Panting and red-
    <br>faced, Stephen would come, with outstretched hands and eager eyes, 
    <br>invade the conversation, shake both of Yates’s arms loose in their 
    <br>sockets, and begin—

    <br>every last cent of it. You all know, without my telling you, what sorrow it 
    <br>has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such 
    <br>patient and generous friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer—by far the 
    <br>sharpest—is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I 
    <br>have come to this place this morning especially to make the 
    <br>announcement that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off 
    <br>all my debts! And most especially I wanted </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">him </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to be here when I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">announced it. Yes, my faithful friend,—my benefactor, I’ve found the

    <br>under many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen 
    <br>and many varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for 
    <br>Mr. Bixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with 
    <br>somebody else. I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience; 
    <br>for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly 
    <br>acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are to 
    <br>be found in fiction, biography, or history. The fact is daily borne in upon 
    <br>me, that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years 
    <br>to equip a man with this sort of an education. When I say I am still 
    <br>profiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of men—no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not made. 
    <br>My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it which I value 
    <br>most is the zest which that early experience has given to my later 
    <br>reading. When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I 
    <br>generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have 
    <br>known him before—met him on the river.

    <br>vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer ‘Pennsylvania’—the man 
    <br>referred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and 
    <br>tiresome. He was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, 
    <br>horse-faced, ignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-
    <br>magnifying tyrant. I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at 
    <br>my heart. No matter how good a time I might have been having with the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">off-watch below, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I 
    <br>started aloft, my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached 
    <br>the pilot-house.

    <br>ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to be semi-
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous a boat. 
    <br>Brown was at the wheel. I paused in the middle of the room, all fixed to 
    <br>make my bow, but Brown did not look around. I thought he took a

    <br>the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I said, apologetically:—‘I

    <br>for his boss, George Ealer, was as kindhearted as Brown wasn’t. Ritchie 
    <br>had steeled for Brown the season before; consequently he knew exactly 
    <br>how to entertain himself and plague me, all by the one operation. 
    <br>Whenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer’s watch, Ritchie would 
    <br>sit back on the bench and play Brown, with continual ejaculations of 
    <br>‘Snatch her! snatch her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!’ ‘Here! Where you 
    <br>going </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">now</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">? Going to run over that snag?’ ‘Pull her </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">down</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">! Don’t you hear 
    <br>me? Pull her </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">down!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">’ ‘There she goes! </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">Just </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">as I expected!

    <br>sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie’s good-natured badgering was 
    <br>pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown’s dead-earnest nagging.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">take everything his boss gave, in the way of vigorous comment and 
    <br>criticism; and we all believed that there was a United States law making 
    <br>it a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty.

    <br>Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty, I threw 
    <br>business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown every night 
    <br>for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new and 
    <br>picturesque ones;—ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness of 
    <br>design and ghastliness of situation and environment.

    <br>find no plausible pretext, he would invent one. He would scold you for 
    <br>shaving a shore, and for not shaving it; for hugging a bar, and for not 
    <br>hugging it; for ‘pulling down’ when not invited, and for not pulling down 
    <br>when not invited; for firing up without orders, and for waiting </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">for</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> orders. 
    <br>In a word, it was his invariable rule to find fault with </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">everything </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">you did; 
    <br>and another invariable rule of his was to throw all his remarks (to you)

    <br>laden. Brown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the other, 
    <br>standing by to ‘pull down’ or ‘shove up.’ He cast a furtive glance at me 
    <br>every now and then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he was 
    <br>trying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape it was going to 
    <br>take. By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual 
    <br>snarly way—

    <br>had never allowed me to round the boat to before; consequently, no 
    <br>matter how I might do the thing, he could find free fault with it. He stood 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">back there with his greedy eye on me, and the result was what might 
    <br>have been foreseen: I lost my head in a quarter of a minute, and didn’t 
    <br>know what I was about; I started too early to bring the boat around, but 
    <br>detected a green gleam of joy in Brown’s eye, and corrected my mistake; 
    <br>I started around once more while too high up, but corrected myself again 
    <br>in time; I made other false moves, and still managed to save myself; but 
    <br>at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled into the very worst 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">blunder of all—I got too far down before beginning to fetch the boat 
    <br>around. Brown’s chance was come.

    <br>Brown gave no intimation that he had heard anything. But that was his 
    <br>way: he never condescended to take notice of an under clerk. The wind

    <br>with this person while I had the chance; consequently I stuck to him and 
    <br>pounded him with my fists a considerable time—I do not know how long, 
    <br>the pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was;—but in 
    <br>the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a very 
    <br>natural solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat tearing 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody at the 
    <br>helm! However, Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full stage, 
    <br>and correspondingly long and deep; and the boat was steering herself 
    <br>straight down the middle and taking no chances. Still, that was only 
    <br>luck—a body </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">might </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">have found her charging into the woods.

    <br>reformed his ferocious speeches for him, and put them into good 
    <br>English, calling his attention to the advantage of pure English over the 
    <br>bastard dialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted. 
    <br>He could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere 
    <br>vituperation, of course; but he was not equipped for this species of 
    <br>controversy; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel, 
    <br>muttering and shaking his head; and I retired to the bench. The racket 
    <br>had brought everybody to the hurricane deck, and I trembled when I saw 
    <br>the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd. I said to myself, 
    <br>‘Now I </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">am</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> done for!’—For although, as a rule, he was so fatherly and 
    <br>indulgent toward the boat’s family, and so patient of minor 
    <br>shortcomings, he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it.

    <br>I would go and hide somewhere till I got a chance to slide ashore. So I 
    <br>slipped out of the pilot-house, and down the steps, and around to the

    <br>finding another pilot; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight 
    <br>watch, and leave the night watches to George Ealer. But I was afraid; I 
    <br>had never stood a watch of any sort by myself, and I believed I should be 
    <br>sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute, or ground the boat in a 
    <br>near cut through some bar or other. Brown remained in his place; but he 
    <br>would not travel with me. So the captain gave me an order on the captain 
    <br>of the ‘A. T. Lacey,’ for a passage to St. Louis, and said he would find a 
    <br>new pilot there and my steersman’s berth could then be resumed. The 
    <br>‘Lacey’ was to leave a couple of days after the ‘Pennsylvania.’

    <br>freight pile on the levee till midnight. The subject of the chat, mainly, 
    <br>was one which I think we had not exploited before—steamboat disasters. 
    <br>One was then on its way to us, little as we suspected it; the water which 
    <br>was to make the steam which should cause it, was washing past some 
    <br>point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we talked;—but it would 
    <br>arrive at the right time and the right place. We doubted if persons not 
    <br>clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster and 
    <br>attendant panic; still, they might be of </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">some </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">use; so we decided that if a 
    <br>disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least stick to the 
    <br>boat, and give such minor service as chance might throw in the way. 
    <br>Henry remembered this, afterward, when the disaster came, and acted 
    <br>accordingly.

    <br>creeping along, north of Ship Island, about sixty miles below Memphis 
    <br>on a half-head of steam, towing a wood-flat which was fast being 
    <br>emptied. George Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone, I think; the second 
    <br>engineer and a striker had the watch in the engine room; the second 
    <br>mate had the watch on deck; George Black, Mr. Wood, and my brother, 
    <br>clerks, were asleep, as were also Brown and the head engineer, the 
    <br>carpenter, the chief mate, and one striker; Captain Klinefelter was in the 
    <br>barber’s chair, and the barber was preparing to shave him. There were a 
    <br>good many cabin passengers aboard, and three or four hundred deck 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">passengers—so it was said at the time—and not very many of them were 
    <br>astir. The wood being nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to ‘come 
    <br>ahead’ full steam, and the next moment four of the eight boilers 
    <br>exploded with a thunderous crash, and the whole forward third of the 
    <br>boat was hoisted toward the sky! The main part of the mass, with the

    <br>chaotic rubbish—and then, after a little, fire broke out.

    <br>among these were Mr. Wood and my brother, and the carpenter. The 
    <br>carpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck the water 
    <br>seventy-five feet from the boat. Brown, the pilot, and George Black, chief 
    <br>clerk, were never seen or heard of after the explosion. The barber’s chair, 
    <br>with Captain Klinefelter in it and unhurt, was left with its back 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">overhanging vacancy—everything forward of it, floor and all, had 
    <br>disappeared; and the stupefied barber, who was also unhurt, stood with 
    <br>one toe projecting over space, still stirring his lather unconsciously, and 
    <br>saying, not a word.

    <br>and pressed both hands there tightly to keep this protection in its place 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">so that no steam could get to his nose or mouth. He had ample time to

    <br>pilot-house, accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff, and 
    <br>enveloped in a cloud of scalding steam. All of the many who breathed 
    <br>that steam, died; none escaped. But Ealer breathed none of it. He made 
    <br>his way to the free air as quickly as he could; and when the steam cleared 
    <br>away he returned and climbed up on the boilers again, and patiently 
    <br>hunted out each and every one of his chessmen and the several joints of 
    <br>his flute.

    <br>the air. A great many persons had been scalded, a great many crippled; 
    <br>the explosion had driven an iron crowbar through one man’s body—I 
    <br>think they said he was a priest. He did not die at once, and his sufferings 
    <br>were very dreadful. A young French naval cadet, of fifteen, son of a 
    <br>French admiral, was fearfully scalded, but bore his tortures manfully. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Both mates were badly scalded, but they stood to their posts, 
    <br>nevertheless. They drew the wood-boat aft, and they and the captain 
    <br>fought back the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded 
    <br>could be brought there and placed in safety first.

    <br>which was only a few hundred yards away; but Henry presently said he 
    <br>believed he was not hurt (what an unaccountable error!), and therefore 
    <br>would swim back to the boat and help save the wounded. So they parted, 
    <br>and Henry returned.

    <br>who were imprisoned under the ruins were begging piteously for help. 
    <br>All efforts to conquer the fire proved fruitless; so the buckets were 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">presently thrown aside and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to cut 
    <br>the prisoners out. A striker was one of the captives; he said he was not 
    <br>injured, but could not free himself; and when he saw that the fire was 
    <br>likely to drive away the workers, he begged that some one would shoot 
    <br>him, and thus save him from the more dreadful death. The fire did drive 
    <br>the axmen away, and they had to listen, helpless, to this poor fellow’s 
    <br>supplications till the flames ended his miseries.

    <br>had to remain, without food or stimulants, or help for their hurts, during 
    <br>the rest of the day. A steamer came along, finally, and carried the 
    <br>unfortunates to Memphis, and there the most lavish assistance was at 
    <br>once forthcoming. By this time Henry was insensible. The physicians 
    <br>examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal, and naturally turned 
    <br>their main attention to patients who could be saved.

    <br>came every day, with flowers, fruits, and dainties and delicacies of all 
    <br>kinds, and there they remained and nursed the wounded. All the 
    <br>physicians stood watches there, and all the medical students; and the 
    <br>rest of the town furnished money, or whatever else was wanted. And 
    <br>Memphis knew how to do all these things well; for many a disaster like 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the ‘Pennsylvania’s’ had happened near her doors, and she was 
    <br>experienced, above all other cities on the river, in the gracious office of

    <br>me. Two long rows of prostrate forms—more than forty, in all—and every 
    <br>face and head a shapeless wad of loose raw cotton. It was a gruesome 
    <br>spectacle. I watched there six days and nights, and a very melancholy 
    <br>experience it was. There was one daily incident which was peculiarly 
    <br>depressing: this was the removal of the doomed to a chamber apart. It 
    <br>was done in order that the </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">morale </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the other patients might not be 
    <br>injuriously affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony. 
    <br>The fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible, and 
    <br>the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of assistants; but no 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">matter: everybody knew what that cluster of bent forms, with its muffled 
    <br>step and its slow movement meant; and all eyes watched it wistfully, and 
    <br>a shudder went abreast of it like a wave.

    <br>more afterward. But I saw our chief mate carried thither more than once. 
    <br>His hurts were frightful, especially his scalds. He was clothed in linseed 
    <br>oil and raw cotton to his waist, and resembled nothing human. He was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">often out of his mind; and then his pains would make him rave and shout

    <br>into a forecastle, and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew; and he 
    <br>would come to a sitting posture and shout, ‘Hump

    <br>supplement this explosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption or 
    <br>profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty. And 
    <br>now and then while these frenzies possessed him, he would tear off 
    <br>handfuls of the cotton and expose his cooked flesh to view. It was 
    <br>horrible. It was bad for the others, of course—this noise and these 
    <br>exhibitions; so the doctors tried to give him morphine to quiet him. But, 
    <br>in his mind or out of it, he would not take it. He said his wife had been 
    <br>killed by that treacherous drug, and he would die before he would take it. 
    <br>He suspected that the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">medicines and in his water—so he ceased from putting either to his lips. 
    <br>Once, when he had been without water during two sweltering days, he 
    <br>took the dipper in his hand, and the sight of the limpid fluid, and the 
    <br>misery of his thirst, tempted him almost beyond his strength; but he 
    <br>mastered himself and threw it away, and after that he allowed no more to 
    <br>be brought near him. Three times I saw him carried to the death-room, 
    <br>insensible and supposed to be dying; but each time he revived, cursed his 
    <br>attendants, and demanded to be taken back. He lived to be mate of a 
    <br>steamboat again.

    <br>Dr. Peyton, a principal physician, and rich in all the attributes that go to 
    <br>constitute high and flawless character, did all that educated judgment 
    <br>and trained skill could do for Henry; but, as the newspapers had said in 
    <br>the beginning, his hurts were past help. On the evening of the sixth day 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away, and his 
    <br>nerveless fingers ‘picked at his coverlet.’ His hour had struck; we bore 
    <br>him to the death-room, poor boy.

    <br>I resolved to go out there. I enlisted a poet for company, and a

    <br>around, as I should be if unknown; I remembered that it was the custom 
    <br>of steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding stranger with 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the most picturesque and admirable lies, and put the sophisticated friend 
    <br>off with dull and ineffectual facts: so I concluded, that, from a business 
    <br>point of view, it would be an advantage to disguise our party with 
    <br>fictitious names. The idea was certainly good, but it bred infinite bother; 
    <br>for although Smith, Jones, and Johnson are easy names to remember 
    <br>when there is no occasion to remember them, it is next to impossible to 
    <br>recollect them when they are wanted. How do criminals manage to keep 
    <br>a brand-new </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">alias </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">in mind? This is a great mystery. I was innocent; and 
    <br>yet was seldom able to lay my hand on my new name when it was 
    <br>needed; and it seemed to me that if I had had a crime on my conscience 
    <br>to further confuse me, I could never have kept the name by me at all.

    <br>ostentatious displays of money, and pompous squanderings of it, which 
    <br>used to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the 
    <br>bygone days, in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis. In those times, 
    <br>the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given fifty 
    <br>players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from the river. But I 
    <br>suspected that the ranks were thin now, and the steamboatmen no

    <br>affected this water’s mulatto complexion in the least; a score of centuries 
    <br>would succeed no better, perhaps. It comes out of the turbulent, bank-
    <br>caving Missouri, and every tumblerful of it holds nearly an acre of land 
    <br>in solution. I got this fact from the bishop of the diocese. If you will let 
    <br>your glass stand half an hour, you can separate the land from the water 
    <br>as easy as Genesis; and then you will find them both good: the one good 
    <br>to eat, the other good to drink. The land is very nourishing, the water is 
    <br>thoroughly wholesome. The one appeases hunger; the other, thirst. But 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the natives do not take them separately, but together, as nature mixed 
    <br>them. When they find an inch of mud in the bottom of a glass, they stir it 
    <br>up, and then take the draught as they would gruel. It is difficult for a 
    <br>stranger to get used to this batter, but once used to it he will prefer it to 
    <br>water. This is really the case. It is good for steamboating, and good to 
    <br>drink; but it is worthless for all other purposes, except baptizing.

    <br>little changed. It </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">was </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">greatly changed, but it did not seem so; because in 
    <br>St. Louis, as in London and Pittsburgh, you can’t persuade a new thing to 
    <br>look new; the coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the moment you take 
    <br>your hand off it. The place had just about doubled its size, since I was a 
    <br>resident of it, and was now become a city of 400,000 inhabitants; still, in 
    <br>the solid business parts, it looked about as it had looked formerly. Yet I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">am sure there is not as much smoke in St. Louis now as there used to be. 
    <br>The smoke used to bank itself in a dense billowy black canopy over the 
    <br>town, and hide the sky from view. This shelter is very much thinner now; 
    <br>still, there is a sufficiency of smoke there, I think. I heard no complaint.

    <br>measure-defying distances, and remember that I had allowed that

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">course, foolish and inexplicable to-day, at a first glance; yet there were 
    <br>reasons at the time to justify this course.

    <br>fifty years ago, said—‘The streets are narrow, ill paved and ill lighted.’ 
    <br>Those streets are narrow still, of course; many of them are ill paved yet; 
    <br>but the reproach of ill lighting cannot be repeated, now. The ‘Catholic 
    <br>New Church’ was the only notable building then, and Mr. Murray was 
    <br>confidently called upon to admire it, with its ‘species of Grecian portico, 
    <br>surmounted by a kind of steeple, much too diminutive in its proportions, 
    <br>and surmounted by sundry ornaments’ which the unimaginative 
    <br>Scotchman found himself ‘quite unable to describe;’ and therefore was 
    <br>grateful when a German tourist helped him out with the exclamation—
    <br>‘By —, they look exactly like bed-posts!’ St. Louis is well equipped with 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">stately and noble public buildings now, and the little church, which the 
    <br>people used to be so proud of, lost its importance a long time ago. Still, 
    <br>this would not surprise Mr. Murray, if he could come back; for he 
    <br>prophesied the coming greatness of St. Louis with strong confidence.

    <br>The absence of the pervading and jocund steamboatman from the

    <br>occupation is gone, his power has passed away, he is absorbed into the 
    <br>common herd, he grinds at the mill, a shorn Samson and inconspicuous. 
    <br>Half a dozen lifeless steamboats, a mile of empty wharves, a negro 
    <br>fatigued with whiskey stretched asleep, in a wide and soundless vacancy, 
    <br>where the serried hosts of commerce used to contend!{footnote [Capt.

    <br>completely. The mighty bridge, stretching along over our heads, had 
    <br>done its share in the slaughter and spoliation. Remains of former 
    <br>steamboatmen told me, with wan satisfaction, that the bridge doesn’t 
    <br>pay. Still, it can be no sufficient compensation to a corpse, to know that 
    <br>the dynamite that laid him out was not of as good quality as it had been 
    <br>supposed to be.

    <br>out of repair; there was a rich abundance of mud. All this was familiar 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and satisfying; but the ancient armies of drays, and struggling throngs of 
    <br>men, and mountains of freight, were gone; and Sabbath reigned in their 
    <br>stead. The immemorial mile of cheap foul doggeries remained, but 
    <br>business was dull with them; the multitudes of poison-swilling Irishmen 
    <br>had departed, and in their places were a few scattering handfuls of 
    <br>ragged negroes, some drinking, some drunk, some nodding, others 
    <br>asleep. St. Louis is a great and prosperous and advancing city; but the

    <br>Orleans. To do this, it would be necessary to go from place to place by 
    <br>the short packet lines. It was an easy plan to make, and would have been 
    <br>an easy one to follow, twenty years ago—but not now. There are wide 
    <br>intervals between boats, these days. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:123382px; width:452px; height:288px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I wanted to begin with the interesting old French settlements of St. 
    <br>Genevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. Louis. There was only 
    <br>one boat advertised for that section—a Grand Tower packet. Still, one 
    <br>boat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable 
    <br>rack-heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for personal 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">property, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her 
    <br>that she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are places in New 
    <br>England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty 
    <br>dollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good—the new crop 
    <br>of wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places. The 
    <br>companionway was of a dry sandy character, and would have been well 
    <br>suited for grapes, with a southern exposure and a little subsoiling. The 
    <br>soil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good enough for grazing 
    <br>purposes. A colored boy was on watch here—nobody else visible. We 
    <br>gathered from him that this calm craft would go, as advertised, ‘if she got 
    <br>her trip;’ if she didn’t get it, she would wait for it.

    <br>be to-morrow or maybe next day. This would not answer at all; so we had 
    <br>to give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm. We had one 
    <br>more arrow in our quiver: a Vicksburg packet, the ‘Gold Dust,’ was to 
    <br>leave at 5 P.M. We took passage in her for Memphis, and gave up the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">idea of stopping off here and there, as being impracticable. She was neat, 
    <br>clean, and comfortable. We camped on the boiler deck, and bought some

    <br>from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis thirty-four years and 
    <br>had never been across the river during that period. Then he wandered 
    <br>into a very flowing lecture, filled with classic names and allusions, which 
    <br>was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather apparent 
    <br>that this was not the first time, nor perhaps the fiftieth, that the speech 
    <br>had been delivered. He was a good deal of a character, and much better 
    <br>company than the sappy literature he was selling. A random remark, 
    <br>connecting Irishmen and beer, brought this nugget of information out of 
    <br>him— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:124294px; width:454px; height:68px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">They don’t drink it, sir. They can’t drink it, sir. Give an Irishman lager for 
    <br>a month, and he’s a dead man. An Irishman is lined with copper, and the 
    <br>beer corrodes it. But whiskey polishes the copper and is the saving of 
    <br>him, sir.’

    <br>crept toward the shore, in the thick darkness, a blinding glory of white 
    <br>electric light burst suddenly from our forecastle, and lit up the water and 
    <br>the warehouses as with a noon-day glare. Another big change, this—no 
    <br>more flickering, smoky, pitch-dripping, ineffectual torch-baskets, now: 
    <br>their day is past. Next, instead of calling out a score of hands to man the 
    <br>stage, a couple of men and a hatful of steam lowered it from the derrick 
    <br>where it was suspended, launched it, deposited it in just the right spot, 
    <br>and the whole thing was over and done with before a mate in the olden 
    <br>time could have got his profanity-mill adjusted to begin the preparatory 
    <br>services. Why this new and simple method of handling the stages was 
    <br>not thought of when the first steamboat was built, is a mystery which 
    <br>helps one to realize what a dull-witted slug the average human being is.

    <br>we were rounding to at a rocky point where there was an old stone 
    <br>warehouse—at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed dwelling-
    <br>houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but there were no 
    <br>evidences of human or other animal life to be seen. I wondered if I had 
    <br>forgotten the river; for I had no recollection whatever of this place; the 
    <br>shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar; there was nothing in sight, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">anywhere, that I could remember ever having seen before. I was 
    <br>surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.

    <br>afoot.

    <br>people were evidently bound for a large town which lay shut in behind a 
    <br>tow-head (i.e., new island) a couple of miles below this landing. I 
    <br>couldn’t remember that town; I couldn’t place it, couldn’t call its name. 
    <br>So I lost part of my temper. I suspected that it might be St. Genevieve—
    <br>and so it proved to be. Observe what this eccentric river had been about: 
    <br>it had built up this huge useless tow-head directly in front of this town, 
    <br>cut off its river communications, fenced it away completely, and made a 
    <br>‘country’ town of it. It is a fine old place, too, and deserved a better fate. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">It was settled by the French, and is a relic of a time when one could travel

    <br>like man;” and if you stay with that kind of a man, you’ll come under 
    <br>suspicion by and by, just as sure as you live. He paid first-class wages; 
    <br>but said I, What’s wages when your reputation’s in danger? So I let the 
    <br>wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I’ve never regretted it. 
    <br>Reputation’s worth everything, ain’t it? That’s the way I look at it. He 
    <br>had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world—all packed in 
    <br>the stern-sheets of his skull, of course, where they belonged. They 
    <br>weighed down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt up in the 
    <br>air. People thought it was vanity, but it wasn’t, it was malice. If you only 
    <br>saw his foot, you’d take him to be nineteen feet high, but he wasn’t; it 
    <br>was because his foot was out of drawing. He was intended to be nineteen 
    <br>feet high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he didn’t get there; he 
    <br>was only five feet ten. That’s what he was, and that’s what he is. You take

    <br>malice out of him, and he’ll disappear. That “Cyclone” was a rattler to go, 
    <br>and the sweetest thing to steer that ever walked the waters. Set her 
    <br>amidships, in a big river, and just let her go; it was all you had to do. She 
    <br>would hold herself on a star all night, if you let her alone. You couldn’t 
    <br>ever feel her rudder. It wasn’t any more labor to steer her than it is to 
    <br>count the Republican vote in a South Carolina election. One morning, 
    <br>just at daybreak, the last trip she ever made, they took her rudder aboard 
    <br>to mend it; I didn’t know anything about it; I backed her out from the 
    <br>wood-yard and went a-weaving down the river all serene. When I had 
    <br>gone about twenty-three miles, and made four horribly crooked 
    <br>crossings—’

    <br>the water on the Missouri side of the river—a piece of nature’s fanciful 
    <br>handiwork—and is one of the most picturesque features of the scenery of 
    <br>that region. For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil’s 
    <br>Bake Oven—so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble 
    <br>anybody else’s bake oven; and the Devil’s Tea Table—this latter a great 
    <br>smooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing wine-glass stem, 
    <br>perched some fifty or sixty feet above the river, beside a beflowered and 
    <br>garlanded precipice, and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for 
    <br>anybody, Devil or Christian. Away down the river we have the Devil’s 
    <br>Elbow and the Devil’s Race-course, and lots of other property of his 
    <br>which I cannot now call to mind.

    <br>new coat of whitewash all over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old 
    <br>coat once more. ‘Uncle’ Mumford, our second officer, said the place had 
    <br>been suffering from high water, and consequently was not looking its 
    <br>best now. But he said it was not strange that it didn’t waste white-wash 
    <br>on itself, for more lime was made there, and of a better quality, than 
    <br>anywhere in the West; and added—‘On a dairy farm you never can get 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">any milk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation; and it 
    <br>is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.’ In my own

    <br>thoroughness as any similar institution in Missouri! There was another 
    <br>college higher up on an airy summit—a bright new edifice, picturesquely 
    <br>and peculiarly towered and pinnacled—a sort of gigantic casters, with the 
    <br>cruets all complete. Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the 
    <br>Athens of Missouri, and contained several colleges besides those already

    <br>He directed my attention to what he called the ‘strong and pervasive

    <br>same day—it may have been the next, and some say it was, though I

    <br>was borne to his home a corpse. This is literally true.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad region—all 
    <br>around and about Hat Island, in early days. A farmer who lived on the 
    <br>Illinois shore there, said that twenty-nine steamboats had left their 
    <br>bones strung along within sight from his house. Between St. Louis and

    <br>was out in the middle of the river now, and throwing a prodigious 
    <br>‘break;’ it used to be close to the shore, and boats went down outside of 
    <br>it. A big island that used to be away out in mid-river, has retired to the 
    <br>Missouri shore, and boats do not go near it any more. The island called 
    <br>Jacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now, and is booked for early 
    <br>destruction. Goose Island is all gone but a little dab the size of a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">steamboat. The perilous ‘Graveyard,’ among whose numberless wrecks 
    <br>we used to pick our way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the 
    <br>channel now, and a terror to nobody. One of the islands formerly called 
    <br>the Two Sisters is gone entirely; the other, which used to lie close to the 
    <br>Illinois shore, is now on the Missouri side, a mile away; it is joined 
    <br>solidly to the shore, and it takes a sharp eye to see where the seam is—
    <br>but it is Illinois ground yet, and the people who live on it have to ferry 
    <br>themselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay Illinois taxes:

    <br>Cairo was still there—easily visible across the long, flat point upon whose

    <br>it. Night fell as we were going out of the ‘Upper River’ and meeting the 
    <br>floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for the hidden rock 
    <br>which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream a long distance 
    <br>out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone into the river 
    <br>from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has ‘made down’ and added 
    <br>to its long tongue of territory correspondingly. The Mississippi is a just 
    <br>and equitable river; it never tumbles one man’s farm overboard without 
    <br>building a new farm just like it for that man’s neighbor. This keeps down 
    <br>hard feelings.

    <br>about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate, as per Mr. 
    <br>Dickens’s portrait of it. However, it was already building with bricks 
    <br>when I had seen it last—which was when Colonel (now General) Grant 
    <br>was drilling his first command there. Uncle Mumford says the libraries 
    <br>and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, as well as the brick 
    <br>masons. Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade, and her situation at 
    <br>the junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous that she cannot 
    <br>well help prospering.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and were approaching Hickman, a pretty town, perched on a handsome 
    <br>hill. Hickman is in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great 
    <br>and lucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in her warehouses 
    <br>from a large area of country and shipping it by boat; but Uncle Mumford 
    <br>says she built a railway to facilitate this commerce a little more, and he 
    <br>thinks it facilitated it the wrong way—took the bulk of the trade out of 
    <br>her hands by ‘collaring it along the line without gathering it at her doors.’

    <br>Belmont. Several of the boat’s officers had seen active service in the 
    <br>Mississippi war-fleet. I gathered that they found themselves sadly out of 
    <br>their element in that kind of business at first, but afterward got 
    <br>accustomed to it, reconciled to it, and more or less at home in it. One of 
    <br>our pilots had his first war experience in the Belmont fight, as a pilot on 
    <br>a boat in the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity to know

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">nobody at his elbow to shame him from showing the white feather when

    <br>was on the ‘R. H. W. Hill.’ Took over a load of troops from Columbus. 
    <br>Came back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner said he was 
    <br>going to see the fight; wanted me to go along. I said, no, I wasn’t anxious, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I would look at it from the pilot-house. He said I was a coward, and left.

    <br>or victory!’ I heard him say that from the pilot-house; and then he 
    <br>galloped in, at the head of his troops. Old General Pillow, with his white 
    <br>hair, mounted on a white horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops as lively 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">as a boy. By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and here they

    <br>a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet. I didn’t stop to 
    <br>think about anything, I just tilted over backwards and landed on the 
    <br>floor, and staid there. The balls came booming around. Three cannon-
    <br>balls went through the chimney; one ball took off the corner of the pilot-
    <br>house; shells were screaming and bursting all around. Mighty warm 
    <br>times—I wished I hadn’t come.

    <br>faster. I crept in behind the big stove, in the middle of the pilot-house. 
    <br>Presently a minie-ball came through the stove, and just grazed my head, 
    <br>and cut my hat. I judged it was time to go away from there. The captain 
    <br>was on the roof with a red-headed major from Memphis—a fine-looking 
    <br>man. I heard him say he wanted to leave here, but ‘that pilot is killed.’ I 
    <br>crept over to the starboard side to pull the bell to set her back; raised up 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and took a look, and I saw about fifteen shot holes through the window 
    <br>panes; had come so lively I hadn’t noticed them. I glanced out on the 
    <br>water, and the spattering shot were like a hailstorm. I thought best to get 
    <br>out of that place. I went down the pilot-house guy, head first—not feet 
    <br>first but head first—slid down—before I struck the deck, the captain said 
    <br>we must leave there. So I climbed up the guy and got on the floor again. 
    <br>About that time, they collared my partner and were bringing him up to 
    <br>the pilot-house between two soldiers. Somebody had said I was killed. 
    <br>He put his head in and saw me on the floor reaching for the backing 
    <br>bells. He said, ‘Oh, hell, he ain’t shot,’ and jerked away from the men 
    <br>who had him by the collar, and ran below. We were there until three 
    <br>o’clock in the afternoon, and then got away all right.

    <br>says, ‘I went down in the hold.’

    <br>fell into conversation with a passenger, a handsome man, with easy 
    <br>carriage and an intelligent face. We were approaching Island No. 10, a 
    <br>place so celebrated during the war. This gentleman’s home was on the 
    <br>main shore in its neighborhood. I had some talk with him about the war 
    <br>times; but presently the discourse fell upon ‘feuds,’ for in no part of the 
    <br>South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held out longer 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">between warring families, than in this particular region. This gentleman

    <br>the worst one was between the Darnells and the Watsons. Nobody don’t 
    <br>know now what the first quarrel was about, it’s so long ago; the Darnells 
    <br>and the Watsons don’t know, if there’s any of them living, which I don’t 
    <br>think there is. Some says it was about a horse or a cow—anyway, it was a 
    <br>little matter; the money in it wasn’t of no consequence—none in the 
    <br>world—both families was rich. The thing could have been fixed up, easy 
    <br>enough; but no, that wouldn’t do. Rough words had been passed; and so, 
    <br>nothing but blood could fix it up after that. That horse or cow, whichever 
    <br>it was, cost sixty years of killing and crippling! Every year or so 
    <br>somebody was shot, on one side or the other; and as fast as one 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">generation was laid out, their sons took up the feud and kept it a-going. 
    <br>And it’s just as I say; they went on shooting each other, year in and year 
    <br>out—making a kind of a religion of it, you see—till they’d done forgot, 
    <br>long ago, what it was all about. Wherever a Darnell caught a Watson, or a 
    <br>Watson caught a Darnell, one of ‘em was going to get hurt—only question 
    <br>was, which of them got the drop on the other. They’d shoot one another 
    <br>down, right in the presence of the family. They didn’t hunt for each 
    <br>other, but when they happened to meet, they puffed and begun. Men 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">would shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A man shot a boy twelve years

    <br>it </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">don’t make no difference</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">, anyway.’ A life-long resident who was 
    <br>present heard it, but it made no impression upon her. She was able to 
    <br>recall the fact afterward, when reminded of it; but she confessed that the 
    <br>words had not grated upon her ear at the time—a confession which 
    <br>suggests that if educated people can hear such blasphemous grammar, 
    <br>from such a source, and be unconscious of the deed, the crime must be 
    <br>tolerably common—so common that the general ear has become dulled 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">by familiarity with it, and is no longer alert, no longer sensitive to such 
    <br>affronts.

    <br>remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, 
    <br>heavily timbered, and lay near the Kentucky shore—within two hundred 
    <br>yards of it, I should say. Now, however, one had to hunt for it with a spy-
    <br>glass. Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and this was no 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against the opposite 
    <br>shore, a mile away. In war times the island had been an important place, 
    <br>for it commanded the situation; and, being heavily fortified, there was no 
    <br>getting by it. It lay between the upper and lower divisions of the Union 
    <br>forces, and kept them separate, until a junction was finally effected 
    <br>across the Missouri neck of land; but the island being itself joined to that 
    <br>neck now, the wide river is without obstruction.

    <br>unchanged from its former condition and aspect. Its blocks of frame-
    <br>houses were still grouped in the same old flat plain, and environed by the 
    <br>same old forests. It was as tranquil as formerly, and apparently had 
    <br>neither grown nor diminished in size. It was said that the recent high 
    <br>water had invaded it and damaged its looks. This was surprising news; 
    <br>for in low water the river bank is very high there (fifty feet), and in my 
    <br>day an overflow had always been considered an impossibility. This 
    <br>present flood of 1882 Will doubtless be celebrated in the river’s history 
    <br>for several generations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen. It 
    <br>put all the unprotected low lands under water, from Cairo to the mouth; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">it broke down the levees in a great many places, on both sides of the 
    <br>river; and in some regions south, when the flood was at its highest, the 
    <br>Mississippi was </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">seventy miles</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> wide! a number of lives were lost, and the 
    <br>destruction of property was fearful. The crops were destroyed, houses 
    <br>washed away, and shelterless men and cattle forced to take refuge on 
    <br>scattering elevations here and there in field and forest, and wait in peril 
    <br>and suffering until the boats put in commission by the national and local 
    <br>governments and by newspaper enterprise could come and rescue them. 
    <br>The properties of multitudes of people were under water for months, and 
    <br>the poorer ones must have starved by the hundred if succor had not been 
    <br>promptly afforded.{footnote [For a detailed and interesting description

    <br>once! an infrequent spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi. The 
    <br>loneliness of this solemn, stupendous flood is impressive—and 
    <br>depressing. League after league, and still league after league, it pours its 
    <br>chocolate tide along, between its solid forest walls, its almost untenanted 
    <br>shores, with seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb the 
    <br>surface and break the monotony of the blank, watery solitude; and so the 
    <br>day goes, the night comes, and again the day—and still the same, night 
    <br>after night and day after day—majestic, unchanging sameness of 
    <br>serenity, repose, tranquillity, lethargy, vacancy—symbol of eternity, 
    <br>realization of the heaven pictured by priest and prophet, and longed for 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">by the good and thoughtless!

    <br>from England; scattering ones at first, then a sort of procession of 
    <br>them—a procession which kept up its plodding, patient march through 
    <br>the land during many, many years. Each tourist took notes, and went 
    <br>home and published a book—a book which was usually calm, truthful, 
    <br>reasonable, kind; but which seemed just the reverse to our tender-footed 
    <br>progenitors. A glance at these tourist-books shows us that in certain of 
    <br>its aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since those 
    <br>strangers visited it, but remains to-day about as it was then. The 
    <br>emotions produced in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not all 
    <br>formed on one pattern, of course; they </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">had </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to be various, along at first, 
    <br>because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate their emotions, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">whereas in older countries one can always borrow emotions from one’s 
    <br>predecessors. And, mind you, emotions are among the toughest things in 
    <br>the world to manufacture out of whole cloth; it is easier to manufacture 
    <br>seven facts than one emotion. Captain Basil Hall. R.N., writing fifty-five

    <br>loaded with alluvial soil; and few of those who are received into its 
    <br>waters ever rise again, {footnote [There was a foolish superstition of 
    <br>some little prevalence in that day, that the Mississippi would neither 
    <br>buoy up a swimmer, nor permit a drowned person’s body to rise to the 
    <br>surface.]} or can support themselves long upon its surface without 
    <br>assistance from some friendly log. It contains the coarsest and most 
    <br>uneatable of fish, such as the cat-fish and such genus, and as you 
    <br>descend, its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the panther 
    <br>basks at its edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man. Pouring 
    <br>its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of little 
    <br>value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its course, 
    <br>which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by the stream

    <br>blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river, which, as if 
    <br>in anger at its being opposed, inundates and devastates the whole 
    <br>country round; and as soon as it forces its way through its former 
    <br>channel, plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest 
    <br>(upon whose branches the bird will never again perch, or the raccoon, 
    <br>the opossum, or the squirrel climb) as traps to the adventurous 
    <br>navigators of its waters by steam, who, borne down upon these concealed 
    <br>dangers which pierce through the planks, very often have not time to 
    <br>steer for and gain the shore before they sink to the bottom. There are no 
    <br>pleasing associations connected with the great common sewer of the 
    <br>Western America, which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf, 
    <br>polluting the clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth. It is a river 
    <br>of desolation; and instead of reminding you, like other beautiful rivers, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man, you imagine it a 
    <br>devil, whose energies have been only overcome by the wonderful power 
    <br>of steam.’

    <br>As he drifted down the turbid current, between the low and marshy 
    <br>shores, the brackish water changed to brine, and the breeze grew fresh 
    <br>with the salt breath of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the great Gulf 
    <br>opened on his sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless, voiceless, 
    <br>lonely as when born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign of life.’

    <br>that was nothing to shudder about—in these modern times. For now the 
    <br>national government has turned the Mississippi into a sort of two-
    <br>thousand-mile torchlight procession. In the head of every crossing, and 
    <br>in the foot of every crossing, the government has set up a clear-burning 
    <br>lamp. You are never entirely in the dark, now; there is always a beacon in 
    <br>sight, either before you, or behind you, or abreast. One might almost say 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">that lamps have been squandered there. Dozens of crossings are lighted 
    <br>which were not shoal when they were created, and have never been shoal 
    <br>since; crossings so plain, too, and also so straight, that a steamboat can 
    <br>take herself through them without any help, after she has been through 
    <br>once. Lamps in such places are of course not wasted; it is much more 
    <br>convenient and comfortable for a pilot to hold on them than on a spread 
    <br>of formless blackness that won’t stay still; and money is saved to the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">boat, at the same time, for she can of course make more miles with her 
    <br>rudder amidships than she can with it squared across her stern and

    <br>It, and some other things together, have knocked all the romance out of 
    <br>it. For instance, the peril from snags is not now what it once was. The 
    <br>government’s snag-boats go patrolling up and down, in these matter-of-
    <br>fact days, pulling the river’s teeth; they have rooted out all the old 
    <br>clusters which made many localities so formidable; and they allow no 
    <br>new ones to collect. Formerly, if your boat got away from you, on a black 
    <br>night, and broke for the woods, it was an anxious time with you; so was it 
    <br>also, when you were groping your way through solidified darkness in a 
    <br>narrow chute; but all that is changed now—you flash out your electric 
    <br>light, transform night into day in the twinkling of an eye, and your perils 
    <br>and anxieties are at an end. Horace Bixby and George Ritchie have 
    <br>charted the crossings and laid out the courses by compass; they have 
    <br>invented a lamp to go with the chart, and have patented the whole. With 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">these helps, one may run in the fog now, with considerable security, and 
    <br>with a confidence unknown in the old days.

    <br>daylight in a box and ready to be turned on whenever needed, and a 
    <br>chart and compass to fight the fog with, piloting, at a good stage of water, 
    <br>is now nearly as safe and simple as driving stage, and is hardly more 
    <br>than three times as romantic.

    <br>Line have raised the captain above the pilot by giving him the bigger 
    <br>wages of the two. This was going far, but they have not stopped there. 
    <br>They have decreed that the pilot shall remain at his post, and stand his 
    <br>watch clear through, whether the boat be under way or tied up to the 
    <br>shore. We, that were once the aristocrats of the river, can’t go to bed 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">now, as we used to do, and sleep while a hundred tons of freight are 
    <br>lugged aboard; no, we must sit in the pilot-house; and keep awake, too. 
    <br>Verily we are being treated like a parcel of mates and engineers. The 
    <br>Government has taken away the romance of our calling; the Company 
    <br>has taken away its state and dignity.

    <br>the service. The military engineers of the Commission have taken upon 
    <br>their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi over again—a job 
    <br>transcended in size by only the original job of creating it. They are 
    <br>building wing-dams here and there, to deflect the current; and dikes to 
    <br>confine it in narrower bounds; and other dikes to make it stay there; and 
    <br>for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi, they are felling the timber-
    <br>front for fifty yards back, with the purpose of shaving the bank down to 
    <br>low-water mark with the slant of a house roof, and ballasting it with 
    <br>stones; and in many places they have protected the wasting shores with 
    <br>rows of piles. One who knows the Mississippi will promptly aver—not 
    <br>aloud, but to himself—that ten thousand River Commissions, with the 
    <br>mines of the world at their back, cannot tame that lawless stream, cannot 
    <br>curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, Go here, or Go there, and make it 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">obey; cannot save a shore which it has sentenced; cannot bar its path 
    <br>with an obstruction which it will not tear down, dance over, and laugh at. 
    <br>But a discreet man will not put these things into spoken words; for the 
    <br>West Point engineers have not their superiors anywhere; they know all 
    <br>that can be known of their abstruse science; and so, since they conceive 
    <br>that they can fetter and handcuff that river and boss him, it is but 
    <br>wisdom for the unscientific man to keep still, lie low, and wait till they do 
    <br>it. Captain Eads, with his jetties, has done a work at the mouth of the 
    <br>Mississippi which seemed clearly impossible; so we do not feel full 
    <br>confidence now to prophesy against like impossibilities. Otherwise one 
    <br>would pipe out and say the Commission might as well bully the comets in 
    <br>their courses and undertake to make them behave, as try to bully the 
    <br>Mississippi into right and reasonable conduct.

    <br>your fingers there for ?—collar that kag of nails!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Four years at West 
    <br>Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a good deal, I 
    <br>reckon, but it won’t learn him the river. You turn one of those little 
    <br>European rivers over to this Commission, with its hard bottom and clear 
    <br>water, and it would just be a holiday job for them to wall it, and pile it, 
    <br>and dike it, and tame it down, and boss it around, and make it go 
    <br>wherever they wanted it to, and stay where they put it, and do just as 
    <br>they said, every time. But this ain’t that kind of a river. They have started 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">in here with big confidence, and the best intentions in the world; but 
    <br>they are going to get left. What does Ecclesiastes vii. 13 say? Says enough 
    <br>to knock </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">their </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">little game galley-west, don’t it? Now you look at their 
    <br>methods once. There at Devil’s Island, in the Upper River, they wanted 
    <br>the water to go one way, the water wanted to go another. So they put up a 
    <br>stone wall. But what does the river care for a stone wall? When it got 
    <br>ready, it just bulged through it. Maybe they can build another that will 
    <br>stay; that is, up there—but not down here they can’t. Down here in the 
    <br>Lower River, they drive some pegs to turn the water away from the shore 
    <br>and stop it from slicing off the bank; very well, don’t it go straight over 
    <br>and cut somebody else’s bank? Certainly. Are they going to peg all the 
    <br>banks? Why, they could buy ground and build a new Mississippi cheaper. 
    <br>They are pegging Bulletin Tow-head now. It won’t do any good. If the 
    <br>river has got a mortgage on that island, it will foreclose, sure, pegs or no 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">pegs. Away down yonder, they have driven two rows of piles straight 
    <br>through the middle of a dry bar half a mile long, which is forty foot out of 
    <br>the water when the river is low. What do you reckon that is for? If I 
    <br>know, I wish I may land in—</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">hump yourself, you son of an undertaker!—
    <br>out with that coal-oil, now, lively, lively!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">And just look at what they are 
    <br>trying to do down there at Milliken’s Bend. There’s been a cut-off in that 
    <br>section, and Vicksburg is left out in the cold. It’s a country town now. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The river strikes in below it; and a boat can’t go up to the town except in 
    <br>high water. Well, they are going to build wing-dams in the bend opposite 
    <br>the foot of 103, and throw the water over and cut off the foot of the island

    <br>of thirty-two barges, containing six hundred thousand bushels (seventy-
    <br>six pounds to the bushel) of coal exclusive of her own fuel, being the 
    <br>largest tow ever taken to New Orleans or anywhere else in the world. Her 
    <br>freight bill, at 3 cents a bushel, amounts to $18,000. It would take 
    <br>eighteen hundred cars, of three hundred and thirty-three bushels to the 
    <br>car, to transport this amount of coal. At $10 per ton, or $100 per car, 
    <br>which would be a fair price for the distance by rail, the freight bill would 
    <br>amount to $180,000, or $162,000 more by rail than by river. The tow 
    <br>will be taken from Pittsburg to New Orleans in fourteen or fifteen days. It 
    <br>would take one hundred trains of eighteen cars to the train to transport 
    <br>this one tow of six hundred thousand bushels of coal, and even if it made 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the usual speed of fast freight lines, it would take one whole summer to

    <br>robbers, horse-thieves, negro-stealers, and counterfeiters, engaged in 
    <br>business along the river some fifty or sixty years ago. While our journey

    <br>were for sale by train boys. According to these, he was the most 
    <br>marvelous creature of his kind that had ever existed. It was a mistake. 
    <br>Murel was his equal in boldness; in pluck; in rapacity; in cruelty, 
    <br>brutality, heartlessness, treachery, and in general and comprehensive 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">vileness and shamelessness; and very much his superior in some larger

    <br>When he traveled, his usual disguise was that of an itinerant preacher; 
    <br>and it is said that his discourses were very ‘soul-moving’—interesting the 
    <br>hearers so much that they forgot to look after their horses, which were 
    <br>carried away by his confederates while he was preaching. But the stealing 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of horses in one State, and selling them in another, was but a small 
    <br>portion of their business; the most lucrative was the enticing slaves to 
    <br>run away from their masters, that they might sell them in another 
    <br>quarter. This was arranged as follows; they would tell a negro that if he 
    <br>would run away from his master, and allow them to sell him, he should 
    <br>receive a portion of the money paid for him, and that upon his return to 
    <br>them a second time they would send him to a free State, where he would 
    <br>be safe. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:153057px; width:454px; height:270px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The poor wretches complied with this request, hoping to obtain money 
    <br>and freedom; they would be sold to another master, and run away again, 
    <br>to their employers; sometimes they would be sold in this manner three 
    <br>or four times, until they had realized three or four thousand dollars by 
    <br>them; but as, after this, there was fear of detection, the usual custom was 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to get rid of the only witness that could be produced against them, which 
    <br>was the negro himself, by murdering him, and throwing his body into the 
    <br>Mississippi. Even if it was established that they had stolen a negro, 
    <br>before he was murdered, they were always prepared to evade 
    <br>punishment; for they concealed the negro who had run away, until he 
    <br>was advertised, and a reward offered to any man who would catch him. 
    <br>An advertisement of this kind warrants the person to take the property, if 
    <br>found. And then the negro becomes a property in trust, when, therefore, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">they sold the negro, it only became a breach of trust, not stealing; and for 
    <br>a breach of trust, the owner of the property can only have redress by a

    <br>be inquired, how it was that Murel escaped Lynch law under such 
    <br>circumstances This will be easily understood when it is stated that he 
    <br>had </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">more than a thousand sworn confederates</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">, all ready at a moment’s 
    <br>notice to support any of the gang who might be in trouble. The names of 
    <br>all the principal confederates of Murel were obtained from himself, in a 
    <br>manner which I shall presently explain. The gang was composed of two 
    <br>classes: the Heads or Council, as they were called, who planned and 
    <br>concerted, but seldom acted; they amounted to about four hundred. The 
    <br>other class were the active agents, and were termed strikers, and 
    <br>amounted to about six hundred and fifty. These were the tools in the 
    <br>hands of the others; they ran all the risk, and received but a small 
    <br>portion of the money; they were in the power of the leaders of the gang, 
    <br>who would sacrifice them at any time by handing them over to justice, or 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">sinking their bodies in the Mississippi. The general rendezvous of this 
    <br>gang of miscreants was on the Arkansas side of the river, where they 
    <br>concealed their negroes in the morasses and cane-brakes. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:153856px; width:452px; height:361px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The depredations of this extensive combination were severely felt; but so 
    <br>well were their plans arranged, that although Murel, who was always 
    <br>active, was everywhere suspected, there was no proof to be obtained. It 
    <br>so happened, however, that a young man of the name of Stewart, who 
    <br>was looking after two slaves which Murel had decoyed away, fell in with 
    <br>him and obtained his confidence, took the oath, and was admitted into 
    <br>the gang as one of the General Council. By this means all was discovered; 
    <br>for Stewart turned traitor, although he had taken the oath, and having 
    <br>obtained every information, exposed the whole concern, the names of all 
    <br>the parties, and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient evidence 
    <br>against Murel, to procure his conviction and sentence to the Penitentiary 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">(Murel was sentenced to fourteen years’ imprisonment); so many people 
    <br>who were supposed to be honest, and bore a respectable name in the 
    <br>different States, were found to be among the list of the Grand Council as 
    <br>published by Stewart, that every attempt was made to throw discredit 
    <br>upon his assertions—his character was vilified, and more than one 
    <br>attempt was made to assassinate him. He was obliged to quit the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Southern States in consequence. It is, however, now well ascertained to 
    <br>have been all true; and although some blame Mr. Stewart for having 
    <br>violated his oath, they no longer attempt to deny that his revelations

    <br>Mr. Stewart, made to him when they were journeying together. I ought to 
    <br>have observed, that the ultimate intentions of Murel and his associates 
    <br>were, by his own account, on a very extended scale; having no less an 
    <br>object in view than </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">raising the blacks against the whites, taking 
    <br>possession of, and plundering new orleans, and making themselves 
    <br>possessors of the territory</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">. The following are a few extracts:— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:154565px; width:454px; height:379px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘I collected all my friends about New Orleans at one of our friends’ 
    <br>houses in that place, and we sat in council three days before we got all 
    <br>our plans to our notion; we then determined to undertake the rebellion 
    <br>at every hazard, and make as many friends as we could for that purpose. 
    <br>Every man’s business being assigned him, I started to Natchez on foot, 
    <br>having sold my horse in New Orleans,—with the intention of stealing 
    <br>another after I started. I walked four days, and no opportunity offered 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">for me to get a horse. The fifth day, about twelve, I had become tired, and 
    <br>stopped at a creek to get some water and rest a little. While I was sitting 
    <br>on a log, looking down the road the way that I had come, a man came in 
    <br>sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him, I was 
    <br>determined to have his horse, if he was in the garb of a traveler. He rode 
    <br>up, and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler. I arose and drew 
    <br>an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount. He did so, 
    <br>and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek, and 
    <br>ordered him to walk before me. He went a few hundred yards and 
    <br>stopped. I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to 
    <br>his shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said, 
    <br>‘If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I die,’ I 
    <br>told him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and dropped 
    <br>on his knees, and I shot him through the back of the head.

    <br>creek. I then searched his pockets, and found four hundred dollars and 
    <br>thirty-seven cents, and a number of papers that I did not take time to 
    <br>examine. I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat, in the creek. 
    <br>His boots were brand-new, and fitted me genteelly; and I put them on 
    <br>and sunk my old shoes in the creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">clothes and put them into his portmanteau, as they were brand-new 
    <br>cloth of the best quality. I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled,

    <br>and started for Georgia. We got in company with a young South 
    <br>Carolinian just before we got to Cumberland Mountain, and Crenshaw 
    <br>soon knew all about his business. He had been to Tennessee to buy a 
    <br>drove of hogs, but when he got there pork was dearer than he calculated, 
    <br>and he declined purchasing. We concluded he was a prize. Crenshaw 
    <br>winked at me; I understood his idea. Crenshaw had traveled the road 
    <br>before, but I never had; we had traveled several miles on the mountain, 
    <br>when he passed near a great precipice; just before we passed it Crenshaw 
    <br>asked me for my whip, which had a pound of lead in the butt; I handed it 
    <br>to him, and he rode up by the side of the South Carolinian, and gave him 
    <br>a blow on the side of the head and tumbled him from his horse; we lit 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">from our horses and fingered his pockets; we got twelve hundred and 
    <br>sixty-two dollars. Crenshaw said he knew a place to hide him, and he 
    <br>gathered him under his arms, and I by his feet, and conveyed him to a 
    <br>deep crevice in the brow of the precipice, and tumbled him into it, and he 
    <br>went out of sight; we then tumbled in his saddle, and took his horse with 
    <br>us, which was worth two hundred dollars.

    <br>been purchased, and giving his suspicions of the men. It was rather 
    <br>squally times, but any port in a storm: we took the negro that night on 
    <br>the bank of a creek which runs by the farm of our friend, and Crenshaw 
    <br>shot him through the head. We took out his entrails and sunk him in the

    <br>one trip—a poor old broken-down, superannuated fellow—left him at the 
    <br>wheel, at the foot of 63, to run off the watch. The ancient mariner went 
    <br>up through the chute, and down the river outside; and up the chute and 
    <br>down the river again; and yet again and again; and handed the boat over 
    <br>to the relieving pilot, at the end of three hours of honest endeavor, at the 
    <br>same old foot of the island where he had originally taken the wheel! A 
    <br>darkey on shore who had observed the boat go by, about thirteen times,

    <br>down along here, During the early weeks of high water, A’s fence rails 
    <br>washed down on B’s ground, and B’s rails washed up in the eddy and 
    <br>landed on A’s ground. A said, ‘Let the thing remain so; I will use your 
    <br>rails, and you use mine.’ But B objected—wouldn’t have it so. One day, A 
    <br>came down on B’s ground to get his rails. B said, ‘I’ll kill you!’ and 
    <br>proceeded for him with his revolver. A said, ‘I’m not armed.’ So B, who 
    <br>wished to do only what was right, threw down his revolver; then pulled a 
    <br>knife, and cut A’s throat all around, but gave his principal attention to 
    <br>the front, and so failed to sever the jugular. Struggling around, A 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">managed to get his hands on the discarded revolver, and shot B dead 
    <br>with it—and recovered from his own injuries.

    <br>coffee, and left me at the wheel, alone, Something presently reminded 
    <br>me of our last hour in St. Louis, part of which I spent on this boat’s 
    <br>hurricane deck, aft. I was joined there by a stranger, who dropped into 
    <br>conversation with me—a brisk young fellow, who said he was born in a 
    <br>town in the interior of Wisconsin, and had never seen a steamboat until a 
    <br>week before. Also said that on the way down from La Crosse he had 
    <br>inspected and examined his boat so diligently and with such passionate 
    <br>interest that he had mastered the whole thing from stem to rudder-
    <br>blade. Asked me where I was from. I answered, New England. ‘Oh, a 
    <br>Yank!’ said he; and went chatting straight along, without waiting for 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">assent or denial. He immediately proposed to take me all over the boat 
    <br>and tell me the names of her different parts, and teach me their uses. 
    <br>Before I could enter protest or excuse, he was already rattling glibly away 
    <br>at his benevolent work; and when I perceived that he was misnaming the 
    <br>things, and inhospitably amusing himself at the expense of an innocent 
    <br>stranger from a far country, I held my peace, and let him have his way. 
    <br>He gave me a world of misinformation; and the further he went, the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">wider his imagination expanded, and the more he enjoyed his cruel work 
    <br>of deceit. Sometimes, after palming off a particularly fantastic and 
    <br>outrageous lie upon me, he was so ‘full of laugh’ that he had to step aside

    <br>staid faithfully by him until his comedy was finished. Then he remarked 
    <br>that he had undertaken to ‘learn’ me all about a steamboat, and had done 
    <br>it; but that if he had overlooked anything, just ask him and he would 
    <br>supply the lack. ‘Anything about this boat that you don’t know the name 
    <br>of or the purpose of, you come to me and I’ll tell you.’ I said I would, and 
    <br>took my departure; disappeared, and approached him from another

    <br>himself up and writhing this way and that, in the throes of unappeasable 
    <br>laughter. He must have made himself sick; for he was not publicly visible

    <br>see too many summer sunrises on the Mississippi. They are enchanting. 
    <br>First, there is the eloquence of silence; for a deep hush broods 
    <br>everywhere. Next, there is the haunting sense of loneliness, isolation, 
    <br>remoteness from the worry and bustle of the world. The dawn creeps in 
    <br>stealthily; the solid walls of black forest soften to gray, and vast stretches 
    <br>of the river open up and reveal themselves; the water is glass-smooth, 
    <br>gives off spectral little wreaths of white mist, there is not the faintest 
    <br>breath of wind, nor stir of leaf; the tranquillity is profound and infinitely 
    <br>satisfying. Then a bird pipes up, another follows, and soon the pipings 
    <br>develop into a jubilant riot of music. You see none of the birds; you 
    <br>simply move through an atmosphere of song which seems to sing itself. 
    <br>When the light has become a little stronger, you have one of the fairest 
    <br>and softest pictures imaginable. You have the intense green of the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">massed and crowded foliage near by; you see it paling shade by shade in 
    <br>front of you; upon the next projecting cape, a mile off or more, the tint 
    <br>has lightened to the tender young green of spring; the cape beyond that 
    <br>one has almost lost color, and the furthest one, miles away under the 
    <br>horizon, sleeps upon the water a mere dim vapor, and hardly separable 
    <br>from the sky above it and about it. And all this stretch of river is a mirror, 
    <br>and you have the shadowy reflections of the leafage and the curving 
    <br>shores and the receding capes pictured in it. Well, that is all beautiful; 
    <br>soft and rich and beautiful; and when the sun gets well up, and 
    <br>distributes a pink flush here and a powder of gold yonder and a purple 
    <br>haze where it will yield the best effect, you grant that you have seen 
    <br>something that is worth remembering.

    <br>the boat struck a snag in the head of Kentucky Bend, and sank with

    <br>the captain got aft. So he cut into his wife’s state-room from above with 
    <br>an ax; she was asleep in the upper berth, the roof a flimsier one than was

    <br>accurate, ‘It’s a hell of a place.’ A description which was photographic for 
    <br>exactness. There were several rows and clusters of shabby frame-houses, 
    <br>and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a famine in that 
    <br>article for a hundred years; for the overflow had but lately subsided. 
    <br>There were stagnant ponds in the streets, here and there, and a dozen 
    <br>rude scows were scattered about, lying aground wherever they happened 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to have been when the waters drained off and people could do their 
    <br>visiting and shopping on foot once more. Still, it is a thriving place, with 
    <br>a rich country behind it, an elevator in front of it, and also a fine big mill 
    <br>for the manufacture of cotton-seed oil. I had never seen this kind of a 
    <br>mill before.

    <br>or $13 a ton now, and none of it is thrown away. The oil made from it is 
    <br>colorless, tasteless, and almost if not entirely odorless. It is claimed that 
    <br>it can, by proper manipulation, be made to resemble and perform the 
    <br>office of any and all oils, and be produced at a cheaper rate than the 
    <br>cheapest of the originals. Sagacious people shipped it to Italy, doctored 
    <br>it, labeled it, and brought it back as olive oil. This trade grew to be so 
    <br>formidable that Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory impost upon it to

    <br>errand there. Time, noonday; and bright and sunny. This was bad—not 
    <br>best, anyway; for mine was not (preferably) a noonday kind of errand. 
    <br>The more I thought, the more that fact pushed itself upon me—now in 
    <br>one form, now in another. Finally, it took the form of a distinct question: 
    <br>is it good common sense to do the errand in daytime, when, by a little 
    <br>sacrifice of comfort and inclination, you can have night for it, and no 
    <br>inquisitive eyes around. This settled it. Plain question and plain answer 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">make the shortest road out of most perplexities.

    <br>annoyance and disappointment, but that upon reflection it really seemed 
    <br>best that we put our luggage ashore and stop over at Napoleon. Their 
    <br>disapproval was prompt and loud; their language mutinous. Their main 
    <br>argument was one which has always been the first to come to the surface, 
    <br>in such cases, since the beginning of time: ‘But you decided 
    <br>and </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">agreed </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to stick to this boat, etc.; as if, having determined to do an

    <br>success: under which encouragement, I increased my efforts; and, to 
    <br>show them that I had not created this annoying errand, and was in no

    <br>corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their backs on slightly slanted 
    <br>boards, in three long rows—all of them with wax-white, rigid faces, and 
    <br>all of them wrapped in white shrouds. Along the sides of the room were 
    <br>deep alcoves, like bay windows; and in each of these lay several marble-
    <br>visaged babes, utterly hidden and buried under banks of fresh flowers, 
    <br>all but their faces and crossed hands. Around a finger of each of these 
    <br>fifty still forms, both great and small, was a ring; and from the ring a 
    <br>wire led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a watch-room yonder, 
    <br>where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert and ready to spring to 
    <br>the aid of any of that pallid company who, waking out of death, shall 
    <br>make a movement—for any, even the slightest, movement will twitch the 
    <br>wire and ring that fearful bell. I imagined myself a death-sentinel 
    <br>drowsing there alone, far in the dragging watches of some wailing, gusty 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">night, and having in a twinkling all my body stricken to quivering jelly by 
    <br>the sudden clamor of that awful summons! So I inquired about this 
    <br>thing; asked what resulted usually? if the watchman died, and the 
    <br>restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last moments 
    <br>easy. But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle and frivolous curiosity 
    <br>in so solemn and so mournful a place; and went my way with a humbled 
    <br>crest.

    <br>Could you have endured an hour of it, do you think? Pity me, then, who 
    <br>had to endure three. Three hours—? it was three ages! Whenever the 
    <br>clock struck, it seemed as if years had gone by since I had heard it last. 
    <br>All this time I was struggling in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got 
    <br>myself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I was able to 
    <br>distinguish details pretty well. The floor was littered with things thrown 
    <br>there by the robbers during their search for my savings. The first object 
    <br>that caught my particular attention was a document of mine which I had 
    <br>seen the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast away. It had 
    <br>blood on it! I staggered to the other end of the room. Oh, poor 
    <br>unoffending, helpless ones, there they lay, their troubles ended, mine 
    <br>begun! 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:168945px; width:449px; height:434px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Did I appeal to the law—I? Does it quench the pauper’s thirst if the King 
    <br>drink for him? Oh, no, no, no—I wanted no impertinent interference of 
    <br>the law. Laws and the gallows could not pay the debt that was owing to 
    <br>me! Let the laws leave the matter in my hands, and have no fears: I 
    <br>would find the debtor and collect the debt. How accomplish this, do you 
    <br>say? How accomplish it, and feel so sure about it, when I had neither 
    <br>seen the robbers’ faces, nor heard their natural voices, nor had any idea 
    <br>who they might be? Nevertheless, I </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">was </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">sure—quite sure, quite 
    <br>confident. I had a clue—a clue which you would not have valued—a clue 
    <br>which would not have greatly helped even a detective, since he would 
    <br>lack the secret of how to apply it. I shall come to that, presently—you 
    <br>shall see. Let us go on, now, taking things in their due order. There was 
    <br>one circumstance which gave me a slant in a definite direction to begin 
    <br>with: Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp disguise; and 
    <br>not new to military service, but old in it—regulars, perhaps; they did not 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">acquire their soldierly attitude, gestures, carriage, in a day, nor a month, 
    <br>nor yet in a year. So I thought, but said nothing. And one of them had 
    <br>said, ‘the captain’s voice, by G—!’—the one whose life I would have. Two 
    <br>miles away, several regiments were in camp, and two companies of U.S. 
    <br>cavalry. When I learned that Captain Blakely, of Company C had passed 
    <br>our way, that night, with an escort, I said nothing, but in that company I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">resolved to seek my man. In conversation I studiously and persistently 
    <br>described the robbers as tramps, camp followers; and among this class 
    <br>the people made useless search, none suspecting the soldiers but me.

    <br>myself out of various odds and ends of clothing; in the nearest village I 
    <br>bought a pair of blue goggles. By-and-bye, when the military camp broke 
    <br>up, and Company C was ordered a hundred miles north, to Napoleon, I 
    <br>secreted my small hoard of money in my belt, and took my departure in 
    <br>the night. When Company C arrived in Napoleon, I was already there. 
    <br>Yes, I was there, with a new trade—fortune-teller. Not to seem partial, I 
    <br>made friends and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned 
    <br>there; but I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions. I made 
    <br>myself limitlessly obliging to these particular men; they could ask me no 
    <br>favor, put upon me no risk, which I would decline. I became the willing 
    <br>butt of their jokes; this perfected my popularity; I became a favorite.

    <br>my idea in this nonsense? It was this: When I was a youth, I knew an old 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Frenchman who had been a prison-keeper for thirty years, and he told 
    <br>me that there was one thing about a person which never changed, from 
    <br>the cradle to the grave—the lines in the ball of the thumb; and he said 
    <br>that these lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human 
    <br>beings. In these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang his 
    <br>picture in the Rogues’ Gallery for future reference; but that Frenchman, 
    <br>in his day, used to take a print of the ball of a new prisoner’s thumb and

    <br>with that document by my side which bore the right-hand thumb-and-
    <br>finger-marks of that unknown murderer, printed with the dearest

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">figure, or face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things! I believed 
    <br>I might feel sure; the Frenchman’s repeated demonstrations being so 
    <br>good a warranty. Still, there was a way to </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">make </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">sure. I had an impression 
    <br>of Kruger’s left thumb. In the morning I took him aside when he was off

    <br>impressively—

    <br>long fortune—purposely so long that I could not finish it; promised to 
    <br>come to him on guard, that night, and tell him the really important part 
    <br>of it—the tragical part of it, I said—so must be out of reach of 
    <br>eavesdroppers. They always kept a picket-watch outside the town—mere 
    <br>discipline and ceremony—no occasion for it, no enemy around.

    <br>my way toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch. It 
    <br>was so dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">get out a protecting word. The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at 
    <br>the same moment. I added, ‘It’s only me—the fortune-teller.’ Then I 
    <br>slipped to the poor devil’s side, and without a word I drove my dirk into 
    <br>his heart! </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">Ya wohl</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">, laughed I, it </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">was </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the tragedy part of his fortune,

    <br>my purposeless way. Being out of money, I sought work, and got it; did 
    <br>my duty faithfully about a year, and was then given the berth of night 
    <br>watchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately. The place 
    <br>suited my mood. I liked it. I liked being with the dead—liked being alone 
    <br>with them. I used to wander among those rigid corpses, and peer into 
    <br>their austere faces, by the hour. The later the time, the more impressive 
    <br>it was; I preferred the late time. Sometimes I turned the lights low: this 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could play; always, the 
    <br>dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird and fascinating 
    <br>fancies. Two years ago—I had been there a year then—I was sitting all 
    <br>alone in the watch-room, one gusty winter’s night, chilled, numb, 
    <br>comfortless; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness; the sobbing of 
    <br>the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter 
    <br>upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly that dead-
    <br>bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head! The shock of it 
    <br>nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard it.

    <br>down the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting upright, wagging its 
    <br>head slowly from one side to the other—a grisly spectacle! Its side was 
    <br>toward me. I hurried to it and peered into its face. Heavens, it was Adler!

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">wife and my child; and in three days hence he will have added me to his

    <br>could get about, I went to the dead-house books and got the number of 
    <br>the house which Adler had died in. A wretched lodging-house, it was. It 
    <br>was my idea that he would naturally have gotten hold of Kruger’s effects, 
    <br>being his cousin; and I wanted to get Kruger’s watch, if I could. But while 
    <br>I was sick, Adler’s things had been sold and scattered, all except a few old 
    <br>letters, and some odds and ends of no value. However, through those 
    <br>letters, I traced out a son of Kruger’s, the only relative left. He is a man of 
    <br>thirty now, a shoemaker by trade, and living at No. 14 Konigstrasse, 
    <br>Mannheim—widower, with several small children. Without explaining to 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">him why, I have furnished two-thirds of his support, ever since.

    <br>around and about Germany for more than a year, at considerable cost in 
    <br>money and vexation; and at last I got it. Got it, and was unspeakably 
    <br>glad; opened it, and found nothing in it! Why, I might have known that 
    <br>that bit of paper was not going to stay there all this time. Of course I gave 
    <br>up that ten thousand dollars then; gave it up, and dropped it out of my 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">mind: and most sorrowfully, for I had wanted it for Kruger’s son.

    <br>dropped that long-desired scrap! I recognized it in a moment. Here it

    <br>removable; and that it was in the north wall of the foundation, fourth 
    <br>row from the top, and third stone from the west. The money is secreted 
    <br>behind it. He said the closing sentence was a blind, to mislead in case the

    <br>rich man of him, and I shall sleep the sounder in my grave for knowing 
    <br>that I have done what I could for the son of the man who tried to save my

    <br>profound and impressive silence, which lasted a considerable time; then 
    <br>both men broke into a fusillade of exciting and admiring ejaculations 
    <br>over the strange incidents of the tale; and this, along with a rattling fire 
    <br>of questions, was kept up until all hands were about out of breath. Then 
    <br>my friends began to cool down, and draw off, under shelter of occasional 
    <br>volleys, into silence and abysmal reverie. For ten minutes now, there was 
    <br>stillness. Then Rogers said dreamily—

    <br>everybody concerned, a new trouble broke out: it transpired that these 
    <br>two men were expecting to share equally in the money with me. That was 
    <br>not my idea. I said that if they got half of it between them they might 
    <br>consider themselves lucky. Rogers said—

    <br>Napoleon, a freak of the river here has sorely perplexed the laws of men 
    <br>and made them a vanity and a jest. When the State of Arkansas was 
    <br>chartered, she controlled ‘to the center of the river’—a most unstable 
    <br>line. The State of Mississippi claimed ‘to the channel’—another shifty 
    <br>and unstable line. No. 74 belonged to Arkansas. By and by a cut-off 
    <br>threw this big island out of Arkansas, and yet not within Mississippi. 
    <br>‘Middle of the river’ on one side of it, ‘channel’ on the other. That is as I 
    <br>understand the problem. Whether I have got the details right or wrong, 
    <br>this </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">fact </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">remains: that here is this big and exceedingly valuable island of 
    <br>four thousand acres, thrust out in the cold, and belonging to neither the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">one State nor the other; paying taxes to neither, owing allegiance to 
    <br>neither. One man owns the whole island, and of right is ‘the man without 
    <br>a country.’

    <br>Mississippi. A chap established a whiskey shop there, without a 
    <br>Mississippi license, and enriched himself upon Mississippi custom under 
    <br>Arkansas protection (where no license was in those days required).

    <br>other moving thing seldom seen. Scenery as always: stretch upon stretch 
    <br>of almost unbroken forest, on both sides of the river; soundless solitude. 
    <br>Here and there a cabin or two, standing in small openings on the gray 
    <br>and grassless banks—cabins which had formerly stood a quarter or half-
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">mile farther to the front, and gradually been pulled farther and farther 
    <br>back as the shores caved in. As at Pilcher’s Point, for instance, where the 
    <br>cabins had been moved back three hundred yards in three months, so we 
    <br>were told; but the caving banks had already caught up with them, and

    <br>enterprise which is expected to work wholesome results. Colonel 
    <br>Calhoun, a grandson of the statesman, went to Boston and formed a 
    <br>syndicate which purchased a large tract of land on the river, in Chicot 
    <br>County, Arkansas—some ten thousand acres—for cotton-growing. The 
    <br>purpose is to work on a cash basis: buy at first hands, and handle their 
    <br>own product; supply their negro laborers with provisions and 
    <br>necessaries at a trifling profit, say 8 or 10 per cent.; furnish them 
    <br>comfortable quarters, etc., and encourage them to save money and 
    <br>remain on the place. If this proves a financial success, as seems quite 
    <br>certain, they propose to establish a banking-house in Greenville, and 
    <br>lend money at an unburdensome rate of interest—6 per cent. is spoken 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of.

    <br>steamboatmen—that the planters, although owning the land, were 
    <br>without cash capital; had to hypothecate both land and crop to carry on 
    <br>the business. Consequently, the commission dealer who furnishes the 
    <br>money takes some risk and demands big interest—usually 10 per cent., 
    <br>and 2{half} per cent. for negotiating the loan. The planter has also to buy 
    <br>his supplies through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits. 
    <br>Then when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions, 
    <br>insurance, etc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last, the dealer’s 
    <br>share of that crop is about 25 per cent.‘{footnote [’But what can the State 
    <br>do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging 
    <br>from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of purchasing 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">their crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of

    <br>which I would have hesitated to believe if I had not known him to be a 
    <br>steamboat mate. He was a passenger of ours, a resident of Arkansas City, 
    <br>and bound to Vicksburg to join his boat, a little Sunflower packet. He 
    <br>was an austere man, and had the reputation of being singularly 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">unworldly, for a river man. Among other things, he said that Arkansas 
    <br>had been injured and kept back by generations of exaggerations 
    <br>concerning the mosquitoes here. One may smile, said he, and turn the 
    <br>matter off as being a small thing; but when you come to look at the 
    <br>effects produced, in the way of discouragement of immigration, and 
    <br>diminished values of property, it was quite the opposite of a small thing, 
    <br>or thing in any wise to be coughed down or sneered at. These mosquitoes 
    <br>had been persistently represented as being formidable and lawless; 
    <br>whereas ‘the truth is, they are feeble, insignificant in size, diffident to a 
    <br>fault, sensitive’—and so on, and so on; you would have supposed he was 
    <br>talking about his family. But if he was soft on the Arkansas mosquitoes, 
    <br>he was hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake Providence to make up 
    <br>for it—‘those Lake Providence colossi,’ as he finely called them. He said 
    <br>that two of them could whip a dog, and that four of them could hold a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">man down; and except help come, they would kill him—‘butcher him,’ as 
    <br>he expressed it. Referred in a sort of casual way—and yet significant 
    <br>way—to ‘the fact that the life policy in its simplest form is unknown in 
    <br>Lake Providence—they take out a mosquito policy besides.’ He told many 
    <br>remarkable things about those lawless insects. Among others, said he 
    <br>had seen them try to vote. Noticing that this statement seemed to be a 
    <br>good deal of a strain on us, he modified it a little: said he might have 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">been mistaken, as to that particular, but knew he had seen them around 
    <br>the polls ‘canvassing.’

    <br>St. Genevieve, and several others. There is currentless water—also a big

    <br>by the non-combatants—mainly by the women and children; not to live

    <br>tunnels, driven into the perpendicular clay bank, then branched Y shape,

    <br>no rush and turmoil around the railway station, no struggling over

    <br>and jaded, half smothered creatures group themselves about, stretch

    <br>gossip with the neighbors from the next cave; maybe straggle off home

    <br>man and his wife. Left to tell their story in their own way, those people 
    <br>told it without fire, almost without interest.

    <br>novelty all out; they got used to being bomb-shelled out of home and into 
    <br>the ground; the matter became commonplace. After that, the possibility 
    <br>of their ever being startlingly interesting in their talks about it was gone. 
    <br>What the man said was to this effect:—

    <br>anyway. We hadn’t anything to do, and time hung heavy. Seven Sundays, 
    <br>and all of them broken up at one time or another, in the day or in the 
    <br>night, by a few hours of the awful storm of fire and thunder and iron. At 
    <br>first we used to shin for the holes a good deal faster than we did 
    <br>afterwards. The first time, I forgot the children, and Maria fetched them 
    <br>both along. When she was all safe in the cave she fainted. Two or three 
    <br>weeks afterwards, when she was running for the holes, one morning, 
    <br>through a shell-shower, a big shell burst near her, and covered her all 
    <br>over with dirt, and a piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of false 
    <br>hair from the back of her head. Well, she stopped to get that game-bag 
    <br>before she shoved along again! Was getting used to things already, you 
    <br>see. We all got so that we could tell a good deal about shells; and after 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">that we didn’t always go under shelter if it was a light shower. Us men 
    <br>would loaf around and talk; and a man would say, ‘There she goes!’ and 
    <br>name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it, and go on talking—if 
    <br>there wasn’t any danger from it. If a shell was bursting close over us, we 
    <br>stopped talking and stood still;—uncomfortable, yes, but it wasn’t safe to 
    <br>move. When it let go, we went on talking again, if nobody hurt—maybe 
    <br>saying, ‘That was a ripper!’ or some such commonplace comment before 
    <br>we resumed; or, maybe, we would see a shell poising itself away high in 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the air overhead. In that case, every fellow just whipped out a sudden, 
    <br>‘See you again, gents!’ and shoved. Often and often I saw gangs of ladies

    <br>Organs and church-music mixed up with a bombardment is a powerful 
    <br>queer combination—along at first. Coming out of church, one morning, 
    <br>we had an accident—the only one that happened around me on a 
    <br>Sunday. I was just having a hearty handshake with a friend I hadn’t seen 
    <br>for a while, and saying, ‘Drop into our cave to-night, after bombardment; 
    <br>we’ve got hold of a pint of prime wh—.’ Whiskey, I was going to say, you 
    <br>know, but a shell interrupted. A chunk of it cut the man’s arm off, and 
    <br>left it dangling in my hand. And do you know the thing that is going to 
    <br>stick the longest in my memory, and outlast everything else, little and 
    <br>big, I reckon, is the mean thought I had then? It was ‘the whiskey </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">is

    <br>humble-minded young land-surveyor, with the world before me—to 
    <br>survey, in case anybody wanted it done. I had a contract to survey a route 
    <br>for a great mining-ditch in California, and I was on my way thither, by 
    <br>sea—a three or four weeks’ voyage. There were a good many passengers, 
    <br>but I had very little to say to them; reading and dreaming were my 
    <br>passions, and I avoided conversation in order to indulge these appetites. 
    <br>There were three professional gamblers on board—rough, repulsive 
    <br>fellows. I never had any talk with them, yet I could not help seeing them 
    <br>with some frequency, for they gambled in an upper-deck stateroom every 
    <br>day and night, and in my promenades I often had glimpses of them 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">through their door, which stood a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco 
    <br>smoke and profanity. They were an evil and hateful presence, but I had 
    <br>to put up with it, of course,

    <br>seemed determined to be friendly with me, and I could not have gotten 
    <br>rid of him without running some chance of hurting his feelings, and I 
    <br>was far from wishing to do that. Besides, there was something engaging 
    <br>in his countrified simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first time 
    <br>I saw this Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes and his looks, 
    <br>that he was a grazier or farmer from the backwoods of some western 
    <br>State—doubtless Ohio—and afterward when he dropped into his 
    <br>personal history and I discovered that he </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">was </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">a cattle-raiser from 
    <br>interior Ohio, I was so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">toward him for verifying my instinct.

    <br>make my promenade; and so, in the course of time, his easy-working jaw 
    <br>had told me everything about his business, his prospects, his family, his 
    <br>relatives, his politics—in fact everything that concerned a Backus, living 
    <br>or dead. And meantime I think he had managed to get out of me 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">everything I knew about my trade, my tribe, my purposes, my prospects, 
    <br>and myself. He was a gentle and persuasive genius, and this thing

    <br>his eye would light and his eloquent tongue would turn itself loose. As 
    <br>long as I would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he knew all 
    <br>breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them all with his affectionate 
    <br>tongue. I tramped along in voiceless misery whilst the cattle question

    <br>down on the sofa, and he said—

    <br>you can do me a good turn, and so can I you, if we see fit. I’ve raked and

    <br>He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos of shabby clothes aside, 
    <br>and drew a short stout bag into view for a moment, then buried it again 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and relocked the trunk. Dropping his voice to a cautious low tone, he 
    <br>continued, ‘She’s all there—a round ten thousand dollars in yellow-boys; 
    <br>now this is my little idea: What I don’t know about raising cattle, ain’t 
    <br>worth knowing. There’s mints of money in it, in Californy. Well, I know,

    <br>apologies. I was as much distressed as he was—especially as he seemed 
    <br>so far from having suspected that there was anything improper in his 
    <br>proposition. So I hastened to console him and lead him on to forget his 
    <br>mishap in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery. We were 
    <br>lying at Acapulco; and, as we went on deck, it happened luckily that the 
    <br>crew were just beginning to hoist some beeves aboard in slings. Backus’s 
    <br>melancholy vanished instantly, and with it the memory of his late 
    <br>mistake.

    <br>knew them all, and had afflicted them all with his pet topic. As I moved 
    <br>away, I saw one of the gamblers approach and accost him; then another 
    <br>of them; then the third. I halted; waited; watched; the conversation 
    <br>continued between the four men; it grew earnest; Backus drew gradually 
    <br>away; the gamblers followed, and kept at his elbow. I was uncomfortable. 
    <br>However, as they passed me presently, I heard Backus say, with a tone of 
    <br>persecuted annoyance— 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:195034px; width:440px; height:32px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">‘But it ain’t any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, as I’ve told you a half a

    <br>an ugly black night, with a strong wind blowing, but there was not much 
    <br>sea. I was on deck, alone. Toward ten I started below. A figure issued 
    <br>from the gamblers’ den, and disappeared in the darkness. I experienced 
    <br>a shock, for I was sure it was Backus. I flew down the companion-way, 
    <br>looked about for him, could not find him, then returned to the deck just 
    <br>in time to catch a glimpse of him as he re-entered that confounded nest 
    <br>of rascality. Had he yielded at last? I feared it. What had he gone below 
    <br>for?—His bag of coin? Possibly. I drew near the door, full of bodings. It 
    <br>was a-crack, and I glanced in and saw a sight that made me bitterly wish 
    <br>I had given my attention to saving my poor cattle-friend, instead of 
    <br>reading and dreaming my foolish time away. He was gambling. Worse 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">still, he was being plied with champagne, and was already showing some 
    <br>effect from it. He praised the ‘cider,’ as he called it, and said now that he 
    <br>had got a taste of it he almost believed he would drink it if it was spirits, 
    <br>it was so good and so ahead of anything he had ever run across before. 
    <br>Surreptitious smiles, at this, passed from one rascal to another, and they 
    <br>filled all the glasses, and whilst Backus honestly drained his to the 
    <br>bottom they pretended to do the same, but threw the wine over their 
    <br>shoulders. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:195877px; width:441px; height:87px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I could not bear the scene, so I wandered forward and tried to interest 
    <br>myself in the sea and the voices of the wind. But no, my uneasy spirit 
    <br>kept dragging me back at quarter-hour intervals; and always I saw 
    <br>Backus drinking his wine—fairly and squarely, and the others throwing 
    <br>theirs away. It was the painfullest night I ever spent. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:195979px; width:453px; height:142px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The only hope I had was that we might reach our anchorage with speed—
    <br>that would break up the game. I helped the ship along all I could with my 
    <br>prayers. At last we went booming through the Golden Gate, and my 
    <br>pulses leaped for joy. I hurried back to that door and glanced in. Alas, 
    <br>there was small room for hope—Backus’s eyes were heavy and bloodshot, 
    <br>his sweaty face was crimson, his speech maudlin and thick, his body 
    <br>sawed drunkenly about with the weaving motion of the ship. He drained 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">another glass to the dregs, whilst the cards were being dealt.

    <br>‘magnificent,’ or that they were ‘floating palaces,’—terms which had 
    <br>always been applied to them; terms which did not over-express the 
    <br>admiration with which the people viewed them.

    <br>was certainly unassailable. If Mr. Dickens was comparing these boats 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">with the crown jewels; or with the Taj, or with the Matterhorn; or with 
    <br>some other priceless or wonderful thing which he had seen, they were 
    <br>not magnificent—he was right. The people compared them with what 
    <br>they had seen; and, thus measured, thus judged, the boats were 
    <br>magnificent—the term was the correct one, it was not at all too strong. 
    <br>The people were as right as was Mr. Dickens. The steamboats were finer 
    <br>than anything on shore. Compared with superior dwelling-houses and 
    <br>first-class hotels in the Valley, they were indubitably magnificent, they 
    <br>were ‘palaces.’ To a few people living in New Orleans and St. Louis, they 
    <br>were not magnificent, perhaps; not palaces; but to the great majority of 
    <br>those populations, and to the entire populations spread over both banks 
    <br>between Baton Rouge and St. Louis, they were palaces; they tallied with 
    <br>the citizen’s dream of what magnificence was, and satisfied it.

    <br>with paling fence painted white—in fair repair; brick walk from gate to 
    <br>door; big, square, two-story ‘frame’ house, painted white and porticoed 
    <br>like a Grecian temple—with this difference, that the imposing fluted 
    <br>columns and Corinthian capitals were a pathetic sham, being made of 
    <br>white pine, and painted; iron knocker; brass door knob—discolored, for

    <br>guitar leaning against mamma, blue ribbons fluttering from its neck; the 
    <br>young ladies, as children, in slippers and scalloped pantelettes, one 
    <br>embracing toy horse, the other beguiling kitten with ball of yarn, and 
    <br>both simpering up at mamma, who simpers back. These persons all

    <br>with circlet of ancestral hair in it; Indian arrow-heads, of flint; pair of

    <br>seventy miles is reduced to thirty-five. It is a change which threw 
    <br>Vicksburg’s neighbor, Delta, Louisiana, out into the country and ended 
    <br>its career as a river town. Its whole river-frontage is now occupied by a 
    <br>vast sand-bar, thickly covered with young trees—a growth which will 
    <br>magnify itself into a dense forest by-and-bye, and completely hide the

    <br>judging by the descriptions of the ancient procession of foreign tourists—
    <br>it has not changed in sixty; for it is still small, straggling, and shabby. It 
    <br>had a desperate reputation, morally, in the old keel-boating and early 
    <br>steamboating times—plenty of drinking, carousing, fisticuffing, and 
    <br>killing there, among the riff-raff of the river, in those days. But Natchez-
    <br>on-top-of-the-hill is attractive; has always been attractive. Even Mrs. 
    <br>Trollope (1827) had to confess its charms:

    <br>they call the short intervals of high ground. The town of Natchez is 
    <br>beautifully situated on one of those high spots. The contrast that its 
    <br>bright green hill forms with the dismal line of black forest that stretches 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">on every side, the abundant growth of the pawpaw, palmetto and orange, 
    <br>the copious variety of sweet-scented flowers that flourish there, all make 
    <br>it appear like an oasis in the desert. Natchez is the furthest point to the 
    <br>north at which oranges ripen in the open air, or endure the winter 
    <br>without shelter. With the exception of this sweet spot, I thought all the 
    <br>little towns and villages we passed wretched-looking in the extreme.’

    <br>Vicksburg and Natchez, in my time, ice was jewelry; none but the rich 
    <br>could wear it. But anybody and everybody can have it now. I visited one 
    <br>of the ice-factories in New Orleans, to see what the polar regions might 
    <br>look like when lugged into the edge of the tropics. But there was nothing 
    <br>striking in the aspect of the place. It was merely a spacious house, with 
    <br>some innocent steam machinery in one end of it and some big porcelain 
    <br>pipes running here and there. No, not porcelain—they merely seemed to 
    <br>be; they were iron, but the ammonia which was being breathed through 
    <br>them had coated them to the thickness of your hand with solid milk-
    <br>white ice. It ought to have melted; for one did not require winter clothing 
    <br>in that atmosphere: but it did not melt; the inside of the pipe was too 
    <br>cold. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:204622px; width:454px; height:398px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Sunk into the floor were numberless tin boxes, a foot square and two feet 
    <br>long, and open at the top end. These were full of clear water; and around 
    <br>each box, salt and other proper stuff was packed; also, the ammonia 
    <br>gases were applied to the water in some way which will always remain a 
    <br>secret to me, because I was not able to understand the process. While the 
    <br>water in the boxes gradually froze, men gave it a stir or two with a stick 
    <br>occasionally—to liberate the air-bubbles, I think. Other men were 
    <br>continually lifting out boxes whose contents had become hard frozen. 
    <br>They gave the box a single dip into a vat of boiling water, to melt the 
    <br>block of ice free from its tin coffin, then they shot the block out upon a 
    <br>platform car, and it was ready for market. These big blocks were hard, 
    <br>solid, and crystal-clear. In certain of them, big bouquets of fresh and 
    <br>brilliant tropical flowers had been frozen-in; in others, beautiful silken-
    <br>clad French dolls, and other pretty objects. These blocks were to be set 
    <br>on end in a platter, in the center of dinner-tables, to cool the tropical air; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and also to be ornamental, for the flowers and things imprisoned in them 
    <br>could be seen as through plate glass. I was told that this factory could 
    <br>retail its ice, by wagon, throughout New Orleans, in the humblest 
    <br>dwelling-house quantities, at six or seven dollars a ton, and make a 
    <br>sufficient profit. This being the case, there is business for ice-factories in 
    <br>the North; for we get ice on no such terms there, if one take less than 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">three hundred and fifty pounds at a delivery.

    <br>heard—which I overheard—on board the Cincinnati boat. I awoke out of 
    <br>a fretted sleep, with a dull confusion of voices in my ears. I listened—two 
    <br>men were talking; subject, apparently, the great inundation. I looked out 
    <br>through the open transom. The two men were eating a late breakfast; 
    <br>sitting opposite each other; nobody else around. They closed up the 
    <br>inundation with a few words—having used it, evidently, as a mere ice-
    <br>breaker and acquaintanceship-breeder—then they dropped into 
    <br>business. It soon transpired that they were drummers—one belonging in 
    <br>Cincinnati, the other in New Orleans. Brisk men, energetic of movement 
    <br>and speech; the dollar their god, how to get it their religion.

    <br>like a greenhouse. For we were in the absolute South now—no 
    <br>modifications, no compromises, no half-way measures. The magnolia-
    <br>trees in the Capitol grounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense 
    <br>rich foliage and huge snow-ball blossoms. The scent of the flower is very 
    <br>sweet, but you want distance on it, because it is so powerful. They are not 
    <br>good bedroom blossoms—they might suffocate one in his sleep. We were 
    <br>certainly in the South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and the 
    <br>plantations—vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro quarters 
    <br>clustered together in the middle distance—were in view. And there was a 
    <br>tropical sun overhead and a tropical swelter in the air.

    <br>not conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have been built if 
    <br>he had not run the people mad, a couple of generations ago, with his 
    <br>medieval romances. The South has not yet recovered from the 
    <br>debilitating influence of his books. Admiration of his fantastic heroes 
    <br>and their grotesque ‘chivalry’ doings and romantic juvenilities still 
    <br>survives here, in an atmosphere in which is already perceptible the 
    <br>wholesome and practical nineteenth-century smell of cotton-factories 
    <br>and locomotives; and traces of its inflated language and other windy 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">humbuggeries survive along with it. It is pathetic enough, that a 
    <br>whitewashed castle, with turrets and things—materials all ungenuine 
    <br>within and without, pretending to be what they are not—should ever 
    <br>have been built in this otherwise honorable place; but it is much more 
    <br>pathetic to see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and 
    <br>perpetuation in our day, when it would have been so easy to let dynamite 
    <br>finish what a charitable fire began, and then devote this restoration-
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">money to the building of something genuine.

    <br>told O’Connor he should not live. It seems that Mabry was armed and 
    <br>O’Connor was not. The cause of the difficulty was an old feud about the 
    <br>transfer of some property from Mabry to O’Connor. Later in the 
    <br>afternoon Mabry sent word to O’Connor that he would kill him on sight. 
    <br>This morning Major O’Connor was standing in the door of the 
    <br>Mechanics’ National Bank, of which he was president. General Mabry 
    <br>and another gentleman walked down Gay Street on the opposite side 
    <br>from the bank. O’Connor stepped into the bank, got a shot gun, took 
    <br>deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired. Mabry fell dead, being shot in 
    <br>the left side. As he fell O’Connor fired again, the shot taking effect in 
    <br>Mabry’s thigh. O’Connor then reached into the bank and got another 
    <br>shot gun. About this time Joseph A. Mabry, Jr., son of General Mabry, 
    <br>came rushing down the street, unseen by O’Connor until within forty 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">feet, when the young man fired a pistol, the shot taking effect in 
    <br>O’Connor’s right breast, passing through the body near the heart. The 
    <br>instant Mabry shot, O’Connor turned and fired, the load taking effect in 
    <br>young Mabry’s right breast and side. Mabry fell pierced with twenty 
    <br>buckshot, and almost instantly O’Connor fell dead without a struggle. 
    <br>Mabry tried to rise, but fell back dead. The whole tragedy occurred

    <br>General Mabry had about thirty buckshot in his body. A bystander was 
    <br>painfully wounded in the thigh with a buckshot, and another was 
    <br>wounded in the arm. Four other men had their clothing pierced by 
    <br>buckshot. The affair caused great excitement, and Gay Street was 
    <br>thronged with thousands of people. General Mabry and his son Joe were 
    <br>acquitted only a few days ago of the murder of Moses Lusby and Don 
    <br>Lusby, father and son, whom they killed a few weeks ago. Will Mabry 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">was killed by Don Lusby last Christmas. Major Thomas O’Connor was

    <br>unchanged. When one goes flying through London along a railway 
    <br>propped in the air on tall arches, he may inspect miles of upper 
    <br>bedrooms through the open windows, but the lower half of the houses is 
    <br>under his level and out of sight. Similarly, in high-river stage, in the New

    <br>flat country behind it lies low—representing the bottom of a dish—and as

    <br>general terms, there is no architecture in New Orleans, except in the 
    <br>cemeteries. It seems a strange thing to say of a wealthy, far-seeing, and 
    <br>energetic city of a quarter of a million inhabitants, but it is true. There is 
    <br>a huge granite U.S. Custom-house—costly enough, genuine enough, but 
    <br>as a decoration it is inferior to a gasometer. It looks like a state prison. 
    <br>But it was built before the war. Architecture in America may be said to 
    <br>have been born since the war. New Orleans, I believe, has had the good 
    <br>luck—and in a sense the bad luck—to have had no great fire in late years. 
    <br>It must be so. If the opposite had been the case, I think one would be 
    <br>able to tell the ‘burnt district’ by the radical improvement in its 
    <br>architecture over the old forms. One can do this in Boston and Chicago. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The ‘burnt district’ of Boston was commonplace before the fire; but now 
    <br>there is no commercial district in any city in the world that can surpass 
    <br>it—or perhaps even rival it—in beauty, elegance, and tastefulness. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:213624px; width:439px; height:123px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">However, New Orleans has begun—just this moment, as one may say. 
    <br>When completed, the new Cotton Exchange will be a stately and 
    <br>beautiful building; massive, substantial, full of architectural graces; no 
    <br>shams or false pretenses or uglinesses about it anywhere. To the city, it 
    <br>will be worth many times its cost, for it will breed its species. What has 
    <br>been lacking hitherto, was a model to build toward; something to 
    <br>educate eye and taste; a </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">suggester</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">, so to speak.

    <br>long-headed men. The contrast between the spirit of the city and the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">city’s architecture is like the contrast between waking and sleep. 
    <br>Apparently there is a ‘boom’ in everything but that one dead feature. The 
    <br>water in the gutters used to be stagnant and slimy, and a potent disease-
    <br>breeder; but the gutters are flushed now, two or three times a day, by 
    <br>powerful machinery; in many of the gutters the water never stands still, 
    <br>but has a steady current. Other sanitary improvements have been made; 
    <br>and with such effect that New Orleans claims to be (during the long 
    <br>intervals between the occasional yellow-fever assaults) one of the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">healthiest cities in the Union. There’s plenty of ice now for everybody, 
    <br>manufactured in the town. It is a driving place commercially, and has a

    <br>the best lighted city in the Union, electrically speaking. The New Orleans 
    <br>electric lights were more numerous than those of New York, and very 
    <br>much better. One had this modified noonday not only in Canal and some 
    <br>neighboring chief streets, but all along a stretch of five miles of river 
    <br>frontage. There are good clubs in the city now—several of them but 
    <br>recently organized—and inviting modern-style pleasure resorts at West 
    <br>End and Spanish Fort. The telephone is everywhere. One of the most 
    <br>notable advances is in journalism. The newspapers, as I remember them, 
    <br>were not a striking feature. Now they are. Money is spent upon them 
    <br>with a free hand. They get the news, let it cost what it may. The editorial 
    <br>work is not hack-grinding, but literature. As an example of New Orleans 
    <br>journalistic achievement, it may be mentioned that the ‘Times-
    <br>Democrat’ of August 26, 1882, contained a report of the year’s business 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the towns of the Mississippi Valley, from New Orleans all the way to 
    <br>St. Paul—two thousand miles. That issue of the paper consisted of forty 
    <br>pages; seven columns to the page; two hundred and eighty columns in 
    <br>all; fifteen hundred words to the column; an aggregate of four hundred 
    <br>and twenty thousand words. That is to say, not much short of three times 
    <br>as many words as there are in this book. One may with sorrow contrast 
    <br>this with the architecture of New Orleans.

    <br>New Orleans is reproachless, notwithstanding it remains as it always 
    <br>was. All the dwellings are of wood—in the American part of the town, I 
    <br>mean—and all have a comfortable look. Those in the wealthy quarter are 
    <br>spacious; painted snow-white usually, and generally have wide verandas, 
    <br>or double-verandas, supported by ornamental columns. These mansions 
    <br>stand in the center of large grounds, and rise, garlanded with roses, out 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the midst of swelling masses of shining green foliage and many-
    <br>colored blossoms. No houses could well be in better harmony with their

    <br>comfortable-looking.

    <br>resemblance to houses—sometimes to temples; are built of marble, 
    <br>generally; are architecturally graceful and shapely; they face the walks 
    <br>and driveways of the cemetery; and when one moves through the midst 
    <br>of a thousand or so of them and sees their white roofs and gables 
    <br>stretching into the distance on every hand, the phrase ‘city of the dead’ 
    <br>has all at once a meaning to him. Many of the cemeteries are beautiful, 
    <br>and are kept in perfect order. When one goes from the levee or the 
    <br>business streets near it, to a cemetery, he observes to himself that if 
    <br>those people down there would live as neatly while they are alive as they 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">do after they are dead, they would find many advantages in it; and 
    <br>besides, their quarter would be the wonder and admiration of the 
    <br>business world. Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the 
    <br>portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of 
    <br>bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. 
    <br>A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer 
    <br>in the coarse and ugly but indestructible ‘immortelle’—which is a wreath 
    <br>or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with 
    <br>sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross’s bars—kind of 
    <br>sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: 
    <br>you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care 
    <br>of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands 
    <br>weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron.

    <br>creep along the marble fronts of the vaults, and catch flies. Their changes 
    <br>of color—as to variety—are not up to the creature’s reputation. They 
    <br>change color when a person comes along and hangs up an immortelle;

    <br>curing the sick by the dozen. But it is merest matter-of-course that these

    <br>simple or compound. A Saint can never </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">quite </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">return the principal,

    <br>with here and there a departure from it with pleasant effect; all are 
    <br>plastered on the outside, and nearly all have long, iron-railed verandas 
    <br>running along the several stories. Their chief beauty is the deep, warm, 
    <br>varicolored stain with which time and the weather have enriched the 
    <br>plaster. It harmonizes with all the surroundings, and has as natural a 
    <br>look of belonging there as has the flush upon sunset clouds. This

    <br>There is nothing strikingly remarkable about it; but one can say of it as of 
    <br>the Academy of Music in New York, that if a broom or a shovel has ever 
    <br>been used in it there is no circumstantial evidence to back up the fact. It 
    <br>is curious that cabbages and hay and things do not grow in the Academy 
    <br>of Music; but no doubt it is on account of the interruption of the light by 
    <br>the benches, and the impossibility of hoeing the crop except in the aisles. 
    <br>The fact that the ushers grow their buttonhole-bouquets on the premises 
    <br>shows what might be done if they had the right kind of an agricultural 
    <br>head to the establishment.

    <br>it; the one dim with religious light, the other brilliant with the worldly 
    <br>sort, and lovely with orange-trees and blossomy shrubs; then we drove in 
    <br>the hot sun through the wilderness of houses and out on to the wide dead 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">level beyond, where the villas are, and the water wheels to drain the 
    <br>town, and the commons populous with cows and children; passing by an 
    <br>old cemetery where we were told lie the ashes of an early pirate; but we 
    <br>took him on trust, and did not visit him. He was a pirate with a 
    <br>tremendous and sanguinary history; and as long as he preserved 
    <br>unspotted, in retirement, the dignity of his name and the grandeur of his 
    <br>ancient calling, homage and reverence were his from high and low; but 
    <br>when at last he descended into politics and became a paltry alderman, 
    <br>the public ‘shook’ him, and turned aside and wept. When he died, they 
    <br>set up a monument over him; and little by little he has come into respect 
    <br>again; but it is respect for the pirate, not the alderman. To-day the loyal 
    <br>and generous remember only what he was, and charitably forget what he 
    <br>became.

    <br>with a canal on one hand and a dense wood on the other; and here and 
    <br>there, in the distance, a ragged and angular-limbed and moss-bearded 
    <br>cypress, top standing out, clear cut against the sky, and as quaint of form 
    <br>as the apple-trees in Japanese pictures—such was our course and the 
    <br>surroundings of it. There was an occasional alligator swimming 
    <br>comfortably along in the canal, and an occasional picturesque colored 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">person on the bank, flinging his statue-rigid reflection upon the still

    <br>He was in his last possible perfection there, and justified his fame. In his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish—large ones; as large as one’s 
    <br>thumb—delicate, palatable, appetizing. Also deviled whitebait; also 
    <br>shrimps of choice quality; and a platter of small soft-shell crabs of a most 
    <br>superior breed. The other dishes were what one might get at 
    <br>Delmonico’s, or Buckingham Palace; those I have spoken of can be had 
    <br>in similar perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.

    <br>It is composed of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume, and go 
    <br>through the infantry drill, with broom in place of musket. It is a very 
    <br>pretty sight, on private view. When they perform on the stage of a 
    <br>theater, in the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and fascinating 
    <br>spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual with grace, 
    <br>spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do everything which a human 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">being can possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see them 
    <br>sweep. But I know they could learn. What they have already learned 
    <br>proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the war-path 
    <br>down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there, those 
    <br>thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few 
    <br>minutes. But the girls themselves wouldn’t; so nothing would be really

    <br>Southerner has no use for an r, except at the beginning of a word. He 
    <br>says ‘honah,’ and ‘dinnah,’ and ‘Gove’nuh,’ and ‘befo’ the waw,’ and so 
    <br>on. The words may lack charm to the eye, in print, but they have it to the 
    <br>ear. When did the r disappear from Southern speech, and how did it 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">come to disappear? The custom of dropping it was not borrowed from 
    <br>the North, nor inherited from England. Many Southerners—most

    <br>an ‘at’ where it isn’t needed. I heard an educated gentleman say, ‘Like the 
    <br>flag-officer did.’ His cook or his butler would have said, ‘Like the flag-
    <br>officer done.’ You hear gentlemen say, ‘Where have you been at?’ And 
    <br>here is the aggravated form—heard a ragged street Arab say it to a 
    <br>comrade: ‘I was a-ask’n’ Tom whah you was a-sett’n’ at.’ The very elect 
    <br>carelessly say ‘will’ when they mean ‘shall’; and many of them say, ‘I 
    <br>didn’t go to do it,’ meaning ‘I didn’t mean to do it.’ The Northern word 
    <br>‘guess’—imported from England, where it used to be common, and now 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">regarded by satirical Englishmen as a Yankee original—is but little used 
    <br>among Southerners. They say ‘reckon.’ They haven’t any ‘doesn’t’ in their 
    <br>language; they say ‘don’t’ instead. The unpolished often use ‘went’ for 
    <br>‘gone.’ It is nearly as bad as the Northern ‘hadn’t ought.’ This reminds 
    <br>me that a remark of a very peculiar nature was made here in my 
    <br>neighborhood (in the North) a few days ago: ‘He hadn’t ought to have 
    <br>went.’ How is that? Isn’t that a good deal of a triumph? One knows the 
    <br>orders combined in this half-breed’s architecture without inquiring: one 
    <br>parent Northern, the other Southern. To-day I heard a schoolmistress 
    <br>ask, ‘Where is John gone?’ This form is so common—so nearly universal, 
    <br>in fact—that if she had used ‘whither’ instead of ‘where,’ I think it would 
    <br>have sounded like an affectation.

    <br>month; sometimes as often as once a week; but as a distinct subject for 
    <br>talk, it has long ago been relieved of duty. There are sufficient reasons for 
    <br>this. Given a dinner company of six gentlemen to-day, it can easily 
    <br>happen that four of them—and possibly five—were not in the field at all. 
    <br>So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the war will at no time 
    <br>during the evening become the topic of conversation; and the chances 
    <br>are still greater that if it become the topic it will remain so but a little 
    <br>while. If you add six ladies to the company, you have added six people 
    <br>who saw so little of the dread realities of the war that they ran out of talk 
    <br>concerning them years ago, and now would soon weary of the war topic if 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">you brought it up.

    <br>the war; and every lady you meet saw the war. The war is the great chief 
    <br>topic of conversation. The interest in it is vivid and constant; the interest 
    <br>in other topics is fleeting. Mention of the war will wake up a dull 
    <br>company and set their tongues going, when nearly any other topic would 
    <br>fail. In the South, the war is what A.D. is elsewhere: they date from it. All 
    <br>day long you hear things ‘placed’ as having happened since the waw; or 
    <br>du’in’ the waw; or befo’ the waw; or right aftah the waw; or ‘bout two 
    <br>yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo’ the waw or aftah the waw. It shows 
    <br>how intimately every individual was visited, in his own person, by that 
    <br>tremendous episode. It gives the inexperienced stranger a better idea of 
    <br>what a vast and comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get

    <br>war, each of us, in his own person, seems to have sampled all the

    <br>cold water on them in a fine spray, and take their heads in their mouths 
    <br>and hold them there a moment—to warm back the perishing life 
    <br>perhaps; I do not know. Then, being set down again, the dying creatures 
    <br>would totter gropingly about, with dragging wings, find each other, strike 
    <br>a guesswork blow or two, and fall exhausted once more.

    <br>grand-stand was well filled with the beauty and the chivalry of New 
    <br>Orleans. That phrase is not original with me. It is the Southern

    <br>day, or twenty thousand times a day; or a million times a day—according 
    <br>to the exigencies. He is obliged to use it a million times a day, if he have 
    <br>occasion to speak of respectable men and women that often; for he has 
    <br>no other phrase for such service except that single one. He never tires of 
    <br>it; it always has a fine sound to him. There is a kind of swell medieval 
    <br>bulliness and tinsel about it that pleases his gaudy barbaric soul. If he 
    <br>had been in Palestine in the early times, we should have had no 
    <br>references to ‘much people’ out of him. No, he would have said ‘the 
    <br>beauty and the chivalry of Galilee’ assembled to hear the Sermon on the 
    <br>Mount. It is likely that the men and women of the South are sick enough

    <br>next to that, I prefer the gay and joyous mule-rush. Two red-hot 
    <br>steamboats raging along, neck-and-neck, straining every nerve—that is 
    <br>to say, every rivet in the boilers—quaking and shaking and groaning 
    <br>from stem to stern, spouting white steam from the pipes, pouring black 
    <br>smoke from the chimneys, raining down sparks, parting the river into 
    <br>long breaks of hissing foam—this is sport that makes a body’s very liver 
    <br>curl with enjoyment. A horse-race is pretty tame and colorless in 
    <br>comparison. Still, a horse-race might be well enough, in its way, perhaps, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">if it were not for the tiresome false starts. But then, nobody is ever killed. 
    <br>At least, nobody was ever killed when I was at a horse-race. They have 
    <br>been crippled, it is true; but this is little to the purpose.

    <br>arrived too late to sample—the Mardi-Gras festivities. I saw the 
    <br>procession of the Mystic Crew of Comus there, twenty-four years ago—
    <br>with knights and nobles and so on, clothed in silken and golden Paris-
    <br>made gorgeousnesses, planned and bought for that single night’s use; 
    <br>and in their train all manner of giants, dwarfs, monstrosities, and other 
    <br>diverting grotesquerie—a startling and wonderful sort of show, as it filed 
    <br>solemnly and silently down the street in the light of its smoking and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">flickering torches; but it is said that in these latter days the spectacle is 
    <br>mightily augmented, as to cost, splendor, and variety. There is a chief 
    <br>personage—‘Rex;’ and if I remember rightly, neither this king nor any of 
    <br>his great following of subordinates is known to any outsider. All these 
    <br>people are gentlemen of position and consequence; and it is a proud 
    <br>thing to belong to the organization; so the mystery in which they hide 
    <br>their personality is merely for romance’s sake, and not on account of the 
    <br>police.

    <br>I judge that the religious feature has been pretty well knocked out of it 
    <br>now. Sir Walter has got the advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl and 
    <br>rosary, and he will stay. His medieval business, supplemented by the 
    <br>monsters and the oddities, and the pleasant creatures from fairy-land, is 
    <br>finer to look at than the poor fantastic inventions and performances of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the reveling rabble of the priest’s day, and serves quite as well, perhaps, 
    <br>to emphasize the day and admonish men that the grace-line between the 
    <br>worldly season and the holy one is reached.

    <br>the </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">ancien regime</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px"> and of the Church, and made of a nation of abject 
    <br>slaves a nation of freemen; and Bonaparte instituted the setting of merit 
    <br>above birth, and also so completely stripped the divinity from royalty, 
    <br>that whereas crowned heads in Europe were gods before, they are only 
    <br>men, since, and can never be gods again, but only figureheads, and 
    <br>answerable for their acts like common clay. Such benefactions as these 
    <br>compensate the temporary harm which Bonaparte and the Revolution 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">did, and leave the world in debt to them for these great and permanent 
    <br>services to liberty, humanity, and progress.

    <br>might checks this wave of progress, and even turns it back; sets the world 
    <br>in love with dreams and phantoms; with decayed and swinish forms of 
    <br>religion; with decayed and degraded systems of government; with the 
    <br>sillinesses and emptinesses, sham grandeurs, sham gauds, and sham 
    <br>chivalries of a brainless and worthless long-vanished society. He did 
    <br>measureless harm; more real and lasting harm, perhaps, than any other 
    <br>individual that ever wrote. Most of the world has now outlived good part 
    <br>of these harms, though by no means all of them; but in our South they 
    <br>flourish pretty forcefully still. Not so forcefully as half a generation ago, 
    <br>perhaps, but still forcefully. There, the genuine and wholesome 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">civilization of the nineteenth century is curiously confused and 
    <br>commingled with the Walter Scott Middle-Age sham civilization; and so 
    <br>you have practical, common-sense, progressive ideas, and progressive 
    <br>works; mixed up with the duel, the inflated speech, and the jejune 
    <br>romanticism of an absurd past that is dead, and out of charity ought to 
    <br>be buried. But for the Sir Walter disease, the character of the 
    <br>Southerner—or Southron, according to Sir Walter’s starchier way of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">phrasing it—would be wholly modern, in place of modern and medieval 
    <br>mixed, and the South would be fully a generation further advanced than 
    <br>it is. It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major or

    <br>that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations. For it was he 
    <br>that created rank and caste down there, and also reverence for rank and 
    <br>caste, and pride and pleasure in them. Enough is laid on slavery, without

    <br>existed before the war, that he is in great measure responsible for the 
    <br>war. It seems a little harsh toward a dead man to say that we never 
    <br>should have had any war but for Sir Walter; and yet something of a 
    <br>plausible argument might, perhaps, be made in support of that wild 
    <br>proposition. The Southerner of the American Revolution owned slaves; 
    <br>so did the Southerner of the Civil War: but the former resembles the 
    <br>latter as an Englishman resembles a Frenchman. The change of 
    <br>character can be traced rather more easily to Sir Walter’s influence than 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">to that of any other thing or person.

    <br>penetrated, and how strongly it holds. If one take up a Northern or 
    <br>Southern literary periodical of forty or fifty years ago, he will find it filled 
    <br>with wordy, windy, flowery ‘eloquence,’ romanticism, sentimentality—all 
    <br>imitated from Sir Walter, and sufficiently badly done, too—innocent 
    <br>travesties of his style and methods, in fact. This sort of literature being 
    <br>the fashion in both sections of the country, there was opportunity for the 
    <br>fairest competition; and as a consequence, the South was able to show as 
    <br>many well-known literary names, proportioned to population, as the 
    <br>North could. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:236971px; width:449px; height:197px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">But a change has come, and there is no opportunity now for a fair 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">competition between North and South. For the North has thrown out 
    <br>that old inflated style, whereas the Southern writer still clings to it—
    <br>clings to it and has a restricted market for his wares, as a consequence. 
    <br>There is as much literary talent in the South, now, as ever there was, of 
    <br>course; but its work can gain but slight currency under present 
    <br>conditions; the authors write for the past, not the present; they use 
    <br>obsolete forms, and a dead language. But when a Southerner of genius 
    <br>writes modern English, his book goes upon crutches no longer, but upon 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">wings; and they carry it swiftly all about America and England, and 
    <br>through the great English reprint publishing houses of Germany—as

    <br>Atlanta at seven o’clock Sunday morning; so we got up and received him. 
    <br>We were able to detect him among the crowd of arrivals at the hotel-
    <br>counter by his correspondence with a description of him which had been 
    <br>furnished us from a trustworthy source. He was said to be undersized, 
    <br>red-haired, and somewhat freckled. He was the only man in the party 
    <br>whose outside tallied with this bill of particulars. He was said to be very 
    <br>shy. He is a shy man. Of this there is no doubt. It may not show on the 
    <br>surface, but the shyness is there. After days of intimacy one wonders to 
    <br>see that it is still in about as strong force as ever. There is a fine and 
    <br>beautiful nature hidden behind it, as all know who have read the Uncle 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Remus book; and a fine genius, too, as all know by the same sign. I seem 
    <br>to be talking quite freely about this neighbor; but in talking to the public 
    <br>I am but talking to his personal friends, and these things are permissible 
    <br>among friends.

    <br>Mr. Cable’s house to get a glimpse of the illustrious sage and oracle of the 
    <br>nation’s nurseries. They said—

    <br>that they might hear Uncle Remus’s Tar-Baby story from the lips of 
    <br>Uncle Remus himself—or what, in their outraged eyes, was left of him. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">But it turned out that he had never read aloud to people, and was too shy 
    <br>to venture the attempt now. Mr. Cable and I read from books of ours, to 
    <br>show him what an easy trick it was; but his immortal shyness was proof 
    <br>against even this sagacious strategy, so we had to read about Brer Rabbit 
    <br>ourselves.

    <br>Mr. Warner did not like it, and wanted it improved. He asked me if I was

    <br>not, without stimulants. He said that away out West, once, he had met, 
    <br>and contemplated, and actually shaken hands with a man bearing that 
    <br>impossible name—‘Eschol Sellers.’ He added—

    <br>dangerous; there are probably a thousand Sellerses bearing it, and the

    <br>wished to see—Horace Bixby; formerly pilot under me—or rather, over 
    <br>me—now captain of the great steamer ‘City of Baton Rouge,’ the latest 
    <br>and swiftest addition to the Anchor Line. The same slender figure, the 
    <br>same tight curls, the same springy step, the same alertness, the same 
    <br>decision of eye and answering decision of hand, the same erect military 
    <br>bearing; not an inch gained or lost in girth, not an ounce gained or lost in 
    <br>weight, not a hair turned. It is a curious thing, to leave a man thirty-five 
    <br>years old, and come back at the end of twenty-one years and find him 
    <br>still only thirty-five. I have not had an experience of this kind before, I 
    <br>believe. There were some crow’s-feet, but they counted for next to 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">nothing, since they were inconspicuous.

    <br>to return to St. Louis in her. The captain and I joined a party of ladies 
    <br>and gentlemen, guests of Major Wood, and went down the river fifty-four 
    <br>miles, in a swift tug, to ex-Governor Warmouth’s sugar plantation. 
    <br>Strung along below the city, were a number of decayed, ram-shackly, 
    <br>superannuated old steamboats, not one of which had I ever seen before. 
    <br>They had all been built, and worn out, and thrown aside, since I was here 
    <br>last. This gives one a realizing sense of the frailness of a Mississippi boat 
    <br>and the briefness of its life.

    <br>Jackson’s victory over the British, January 8, 1815. The war had ended, 
    <br>the two nations were at peace, but the news had not yet reached New 
    <br>Orleans. If we had had the cable telegraph in those days, this blood 
    <br>would not have been spilt, those lives would not have been wasted; and 
    <br>better still, Jackson would probably never have been president. We have 
    <br>gotten over the harms done us by the war of 1812, but not over some of

    <br>fashion, too elaborate and complex for me to attempt to describe; but it 
    <br>lost $40,000 last year. I forget the other details. However, this year’s 
    <br>crop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons of sugar, consequently last 
    <br>year’s loss will not matter. These troublesome and expensive scientific 
    <br>methods achieve a yield of a ton and a half and from that to two tons, to

    <br>filters, pumps, pipes, and machinery. The process of making sugar is 
    <br>exceedingly interesting. First, you heave your cane into the centrifugals 
    <br>and grind out the juice; then run it through the evaporating pan to 
    <br>extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to remove the alcohol; then 
    <br>through the clarifying tanks to discharge the molasses; then through the 
    <br>granulating pipe to condense it; then through the vacuum pan to extract 
    <br>the vacuum. It is now ready for market. I have jotted these particulars 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">down from memory. The thing looks simple and easy. Do not deceive

    <br>He applied it to every sentimental remark, and to every pathetic song. He 
    <br>cackled it out with hideous energy after ‘Home again, home again from a

    <br>uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way, half a 
    <br>dozen years before: a cyclone blew him some three miles and knocked a 
    <br>tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and sixty-five 
    <br>feet high. He did not survive this triumph. At the seance just referred to, 
    <br>my friend questioned his late uncle, through Mr. Manchester, and the 
    <br>late uncle wrote down his replies, using Mr. Manchester’s hand and 
    <br>pencil for that purpose. The following is a fair example of the questions 
    <br>asked, and also of the sloppy twaddle in the way of answers, furnished by 
    <br>Manchester under the pretense that it came from the specter. If this man 
    <br>is not the paltriest fraud that lives, I owe him an apology—

    <br>my former friends who had quitted the river, four had chosen farming as 
    <br>an occupation. Of course this was not because they were peculiarly 
    <br>gifted, agriculturally, and thus more likely to succeed as farmers than in 
    <br>other industries: the reason for their choice must be traced to some other 
    <br>source. Doubtless they chose farming because that life is private and 
    <br>secluded from irruptions of undesirable strangers—like the pilot-house 
    <br>hermitage. And doubtless they also chose it because on a thousand 
    <br>nights of black storm and danger they had noted the twinkling lights of 
    <br>solitary farm-houses, as the boat swung by, and pictured to themselves 
    <br>the serenity and security and coziness of such refuges at such times, and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">so had by-and-bye come to dream of that retired and peaceful life as the 
    <br>one desirable thing to long for, anticipate, earn, and at last enjoy.

    <br>anybody with their successes. Their farms do not support them: they 
    <br>support their farms. The pilot-farmer disappears from the river annually, 
    <br>about the breaking of spring, and is seen no more till next frost. Then he 
    <br>appears again, in damaged homespun, combs the hayseed out of his hair, 
    <br>and takes a pilot-house berth for the winter. In this way he pays the 
    <br>debts which his farming has achieved during the agricultural season. So 
    <br>his river bondage is but half broken; he is still the river’s slave the 
    <br>hardest half of the year.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">worth two of that. He did not propose to pauperize his farm by applying 
    <br>his personal ignorance to working it. No, he put the farm into the hands 
    <br>of an agricultural expert to be worked on shares—out of every three loads 
    <br>of corn the expert to have two and the pilot the third. But at the end of 
    <br>the season the pilot received no corn. The expert explained that his share 
    <br>was not reached. The farm produced only two loads.

    <br>ashore, fought his way through a squad of soldiers, and made a gallant 
    <br>and narrow escape. He was always a cool man; nothing could disturb his 
    <br>serenity. Once when he was captain of the ‘Crescent City,’ I was bringing 
    <br>the boat into port at New Orleans, and momently expecting orders from 
    <br>the hurricane deck, but received none. I had stopped the wheels, and 
    <br>there my authority and responsibility ceased. It was evening—dim 
    <br>twilight—the captain’s hat was perched upon the big bell, and I supposed 
    <br>the intellectual end of the captain was in it, but such was not the case. 
    <br>The captain was very strict; therefore I knew better than to touch a bell 
    <br>without orders. My duty was to hold the boat steadily on her calamitous 
    <br>course, and leave the consequences to take care of themselves—which I 
    <br>did. So we went plowing past the sterns of steamboats and getting closer 
    <br>and closer—the crash was bound to come very soon—and still that hat 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">never budged; for alas, the captain was napping in the texas.... Things 
    <br>were becoming exceedingly nervous and uncomfortable. It seemed to me 
    <br>that the captain was not going to appear in time to see the 
    <br>entertainment. But he did. Just as we were walking into the stern of a 
    <br>steamboat, he stepped out on deck, and said, with heavenly serenity, ‘Set 
    <br>her back on both’—which I did; but a trifle late, however, for the next 
    <br>moment we went smashing through that other boat’s flimsy outer works 
    <br>with a most prodigious racket. The captain never said a word to me 
    <br>about the matter afterwards, except to remark that I had done right, and 
    <br>that he hoped I would not hesitate to act in the same way again in like 
    <br>circumstances.

    <br>He was a fine man, a high-minded man, and greatly respected both 
    <br>ashore and on the river. He was very tall, well built, and handsome; and 
    <br>in his old age—as I remember him—his hair was as black as an Indian’s, 
    <br>and his eye and hand were as strong and steady and his nerve and 
    <br>judgment as firm and clear as anybody’s, young or old, among the 
    <br>fraternity of pilots. He was the patriarch of the craft; he had been a 
    <br>keelboat pilot before the day of steamboats; and a steamboat pilot before 
    <br>any other steamboat pilot, still surviving at the time I speak of, had ever 
    <br>turned a wheel. Consequently his brethren held him in the sort of awe in 
    <br>which illustrious survivors of a bygone age are always held by their 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">associates. He knew how he was regarded, and perhaps this fact added 
    <br>some trifle of stiffening to his natural dignity, which had been 
    <br>sufficiently stiff in its original state.

    <br>steamboat trip, which was said to be 1811, the year the first steamboat 
    <br>disturbed the waters of the Mississippi. At the time of his death a 
    <br>correspondent of the ‘St. Louis Republican’ culled the following items 
    <br>from the diary—

    <br>Florence, Ala., and made during that year three trips to New Orleans and 
    <br>back—this on the “Gen. Carrol,” between Nashville and New Orleans. It 
    <br>was during his stay on this boat that Captain Sellers introduced the tap 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of the bell as a signal to heave the lead, previous to which time it was the 
    <br>custom for the pilot to speak to the men below when soundings were

    <br>heads, and the exultation of their recent audience when the ancient 
    <br>captain would begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a 
    <br>reminiscent nature—about islands that had disappeared, and cutoffs that 
    <br>had been made, a generation before the oldest bald-head in the company

    <br>the above fashion, and spread disaster and humiliation around him. If 
    <br>one might believe the pilots, he always dated his islands back to the 
    <br>misty dawn of river history; and he never used the same island twice; 
    <br>and never did he employ an island that still existed, or give one a name 
    <br>which anybody present was old enough to have heard of before. If you 
    <br>might believe the pilots, he was always conscientiously particular about 
    <br>little details; never spoke of ‘the State of Mississippi,’ for instance—no, 
    <br>he would say, ‘When the State of Mississippi was where Arkansas now 
    <br>is,’ and would never speak of Louisiana or Missouri in a general way, and 
    <br>leave an incorrect impression on your mind—no, he would say, ‘When 
    <br>Louisiana was up the river farther,’ or ‘When Missouri was on the Illinois 
    <br>side.’

    <br>They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate 
    <br>and valuable; and thus far, they contained no poison. But in speaking of 
    <br>the stage of the river to-day, at a given point, the captain was pretty apt

    <br>water so high or so low at that particular point for forty-nine years; and

    <br>it.

    <br>day, but with the main purpose of my visit but lamely accomplished. I 
    <br>had hoped to hunt up and talk with a hundred steamboatmen, but got so 
    <br>pleasantly involved in the social life of the town that I got nothing more 
    <br>than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen of the craft. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:255386px; width:449px; height:325px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">I was on the bench of the pilot-house when we backed out and 
    <br>‘straightened up’ for the start—the boat pausing for a ‘good ready,’ in the 
    <br>old-fashioned way, and the black smoke piling out of the chimneys 
    <br>equally in the old-fashioned way. Then we began to gather momentum, 
    <br>and presently were fairly under way and booming along. It was all as 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">natural and familiar—and so were the shoreward sights—as if there had 
    <br>been no break in my river life. There was a ‘cub,’ and I judged that he 
    <br>would take the wheel now; and he did. Captain Bixby stepped into the 
    <br>pilot-house. Presently the cub closed up on the rank of steamships. He 
    <br>made me nervous, for he allowed too much water to show between our 
    <br>boat and the ships. I knew quite well what was going to happen, because 
    <br>I could date back in my own life and inspect the record. The captain 
    <br>looked on, during a silent half-minute, then took the wheel himself, and 
    <br>crowded the boat in, till she went scraping along within a hand-breadth 
    <br>of the ships. It was exactly the favor which he had done me, about a 
    <br>quarter of a century before, in that same spot, the first time I ever 
    <br>steamed out of the port of New Orleans. It was a very great and sincere 
    <br>pleasure to me to see the thing repeated—with somebody else as victim.

    <br>still another about fifty miles below Memphis. They had an old-
    <br>fashioned energy which had long been unfamiliar to me. This third storm 
    <br>was accompanied by a raging wind. We tied up to the bank when we saw 
    <br>the tempest coming, and everybody left the pilot-house but me. The wind 
    <br>bent the young trees down, exposing the pale underside of the leaves; 
    <br>and gust after gust followed, in quick succession, thrashing the branches 
    <br>violently up and down, and to this side and that, and creating swift waves 
    <br>of alternating green and white according to the side of the leaf that was 
    <br>exposed, and these waves raced after each other as do their kind over a 
    <br>wind-tossed field of oats. No color that was visible anywhere was quite 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">natural—all tints were charged with a leaden tinge from the solid cloud-
    <br>bank overhead. The river was leaden; all distances the same; and even 
    <br>the far-reaching ranks of combing white-caps were dully shaded by the 
    <br>dark, rich atmosphere through which their swarming legions marched. 
    <br>The thunder-peals were constant and deafening; explosion followed 
    <br>explosion with but inconsequential intervals between, and the reports 
    <br>grew steadily sharper and higher-keyed, and more trying to the ear; the 
    <br>lightning was as diligent as the thunder, and produced effects which 
    <br>enchanted the eye and sent electric ecstasies of mixed delight and 
    <br>apprehension shivering along every nerve in the body in unintermittent 
    <br>procession. The rain poured down in amazing volume; the ear-splitting 
    <br>thunder-peals broke nearer and nearer; the wind increased in fury and 
    <br>began to wrench off boughs and tree-tops and send them sailing away 
    <br>through space; the pilot-house fell to rocking and straining and cracking 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and surging, and I went down in the hold to see what time it was.

    <br>observable that whenever we landed, and suddenly inundated the trees 
    <br>with the intense sunburst of the electric light, a certain curious effect was 
    <br>always produced: hundreds of birds flocked instantly out from the 
    <br>masses of shining green foliage, and went careering hither and thither 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">through the white rays, and often a song-bird tuned up and fell to 
    <br>singing. We judged that they mistook this superb artificial day for the

    <br>steamer, and regretted that it was accomplished so speedily. By means of 
    <br>diligence and activity, we managed to hunt out nearly all the old friends. 
    <br>One was missing, however; he went to his reward, whatever it was, two 
    <br>years ago. But I found out all about him. His case helped me to realize 
    <br>how lasting can be the effect of a very trifling occurrence. When he was 
    <br>an apprentice-blacksmith in our village, and I a schoolboy, a couple of 
    <br>young Englishmen came to the town and sojourned a while; and one day 
    <br>they got themselves up in cheap royal finery and did the Richard III 
    <br>swordfight with maniac energy and prodigious powwow, in the presence 
    <br>of the village boys. This blacksmith cub was there, and the histrionic 
    <br>poison entered his bones. This vast, lumbering, ignorant, dull-witted lout 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">was stage-struck, and irrecoverably. He disappeared, and presently 
    <br>turned up in St. Louis. I ran across him there, by and by. He was 
    <br>standing musing on a street corner, with his left hand on his hip, the 
    <br>thumb of his right supporting his chin, face bowed and frowning, slouch 
    <br>hat pulled down over his forehead—imagining himself to be Othello or 
    <br>some such character, and imagining that the passing crowd marked his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">tragic bearing and were awestruck.

    <br>ago. I spent a week there, at that time, in a boarding-house, and had this 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">young fellow for a neighbor across the hall. We saw some of the fightings 
    <br>and killings; and by and by we went one night to an armory where two 
    <br>hundred young men had met, upon call, to be armed and go forth against 
    <br>the rioters, under command of a military man. We drilled till about ten 
    <br>o’clock at night; then news came that the mob were in great force in the 
    <br>lower end of the town, and were sweeping everything before them. Our 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">column moved at once. It was a very hot night, and my musket was very 
    <br>heavy. We marched and marched; and the nearer we approached the

    <br>and got a drink. Then I branched off and went home. I was not feeling 
    <br>any solicitude about him of course, because I knew he was so well armed, 
    <br>now, that he could take care of himself without any trouble. If I had had 
    <br>any doubts about that, I would have borrowed another musket for him. I 
    <br>left the city pretty early the next morning, and if this grizzled man had 
    <br>not happened to encounter my name in the papers the other day in St. 
    <br>Louis, and felt moved to seek me out, I should have carried to my grave a 
    <br>heart-torturing uncertainty as to whether he ever got out of the riots all 
    <br>right or not. I ought to have inquired, thirty years ago; I know that. And I 
    <br>would have inquired, if I had had the muskets; but, in the circumstances, 
    <br>he seemed better fixed to conduct the investigations than I was.

    <br>came out with a couple of pages of Sunday statistics, whereby it appeared 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">that 119,448 St. Louis people attended the morning and evening church 
    <br>services the day before, and 23,102 children attended Sunday-school. 
    <br>Thus 142,550 persons, out of the city’s total of 400,000 population, 
    <br>respected the day religious-wise. I found these statistics, in a condensed 
    <br>form, in a telegram of the Associated Press, and preserved them. They 
    <br>made it apparent that St. Louis was in a higher state of grace than she 
    <br>could have claimed to be in my time. But now that I canvass the figures 
    <br>narrowly, I suspect that the telegraph mutilated them. It cannot be that 
    <br>there are more than 150,000 Catholics in the town; the other 250,000 
    <br>must be classified as Protestants. Out of these 250,000, according to this 
    <br>questionable telegram, only 26,362 attended church and Sunday-school, 
    <br>while out of the 150,000 Catholics, 116,188 went to church and Sunday-
    <br>school.

    <br>can do it without breaking down. I must preface it with some 
    <br>explanations, however. The letter is written by an ex-thief and ex-
    <br>vagabond of the lowest origin and basest rearing, a man all stained with 
    <br>crime and steeped in ignorance; but, thank God, with a mine of pure gold 
    <br>hidden away in him, as you shall see. His letter is written to a burglar 
    <br>named Williams, who is serving a nine-year term in a certain State 
    <br>prison, for burglary. Williams was a particularly daring burglar, and 
    <br>plied that trade during a number of years; but he was caught at last and 
    <br>jailed, to await trial in a town where he had broken into a house at night, 
    <br>pistol in hand, and forced the owner to hand over to him $8,000 in 
    <br>government bonds. Williams was not a common sort of person, by any 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">means; he was a graduate of Harvard College, and came of good New 
    <br>England stock. His father was a clergyman. While lying in jail, his health 
    <br>began to fail, and he was threatened with consumption. This fact, 
    <br>together with the opportunity for reflection afforded by solitary 
    <br>confinement, had its effect—its natural effect. He fell into serious 
    <br>thought; his early training asserted itself with power, and wrought with 
    <br>strong influence upon his mind and heart. He put his old life behind him, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and became an earnest Christian. Some ladies in the town heard of this, 
    <br>visited him, and by their encouraging words supported him in his good 
    <br>resolutions and strengthened him to continue in his new life. The trial

    <br>nine years, as I have before said. In the prison he became acquainted 
    <br>with the poor wretch referred to in the beginning of my talk, Jack Hunt, 
    <br>the writer of the letter which I am going to read. You will see that the 
    <br>acquaintanceship bore fruit for Hunt. When Hunt’s time was out, he 
    <br>wandered to St. Louis; and from that place he wrote his letter to 
    <br>Williams. The letter got no further than the office of the prison warden, 
    <br>of course; prisoners are not often allowed to receive letters from outside. 
    <br>The prison authorities read this letter, but did not destroy it. They had 
    <br>not the heart to do it. They read it to several persons, and eventually it 
    <br>fell into the hands of those ladies of whom I spoke a while ago. The other 
    <br>day I came across an old friend of mine—a clergyman—who had seen this 
    <br>letter, and was full of it. The mere remembrance of it so moved him that 
    <br>he could not talk of it without his voice breaking. He promised to get a

    <br>was practising upon me to see if there was any hope of his being able to 
    <br>read the document to his prayer-meeting with anything like a decent 
    <br>command over his feelings. The result was not promising. However, he 
    <br>determined to risk it; and did. He got through tolerably well; but his

    <br>and borrowed the manuscript, put it bodily into a sermon, preached the 
    <br>sermon to twelve hundred people on a Sunday morning, and the letter 
    <br>drowned them in their own tears. Then my friend put it into a sermon 
    <br>and went before his Sunday morning congregation with it. It scored 
    <br>another triumph. The house wept as one individual.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">northern British neighbors, and carried this sermon with him, since he 
    <br>might possibly chance to need a sermon. He was asked to preach, one 
    <br>day. The little church was full. Among the people present were the late 
    <br>Dr. J. G. Holland, the late Mr. Seymour of the ‘New York Times,’ Mr. 
    <br>Page, the philanthropist and temperance advocate, and, I think, Senator 
    <br>Frye, of Maine. The marvelous letter did its wonted work; all the people 
    <br>were moved, all the people wept; the tears flowed in a steady stream 
    <br>down Dr. Holland’s cheeks, and nearly the same can be said with regard 
    <br>to all who were there. Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over the letter 
    <br>that he said he would not rest until he made pilgrimage to that prison, 
    <br>and had speech with the man who had been able to inspire a fellow-
    <br>unfortunate to write so priceless a tract.

    <br>hearts of all the nations for a thousand years to come, and nobody might

    <br>more to inundate audiences with their tears and the tears of said 
    <br>audiences; I begged hard for permission to print the letter in a magazine 
    <br>and tell the watery story of its triumphs; numbers of people got copies of 
    <br>the letter, with permission to circulate them in writing, but not in print; 
    <br>copies were sent to the Sandwich Islands and other far regions.

    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:267830px; width:453px; height:178px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">Dear Bro. Page</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">,—Herewith please find the letter kindly loaned me. I am 
    <br>afraid its genuineness cannot be established. It purports to be addressed 
    <br>to some prisoner here. No such letter ever came to a prisoner here. All 
    <br>letters received are carefully read by officers of the prison before they go 
    <br>into the hands of the convicts, and any such letter could not be forgotten. 
    <br>Again, Charles Williams is not a Christian man, but a dissolute, cunning 
    <br>prodigal, whose father is a minister of the gospel. His name is an 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">assumed one. I am glad to have made your acquaintance. I am preparing 
    <br>a lecture upon life seen through prison bars, and should like to deliver 
    <br>the same in your vicinity.

    <br>whereas the materials for it were now more abundant and infinitely 
    <br>richer than they had previously been, there were parties all around me, 
    <br>who, although longing for the publication before, were a unit for 
    <br>suppression at this stage and complexion of the game. They said: ‘Wait—
    <br>the wound is too fresh, yet.’ All the copies of the famous letter except 
    <br>mine disappeared suddenly; and from that time onward, the aforetime 
    <br>same old drought set in in the churches. As a rule, the town was on a 
    <br>spacious grin for a while, but there were places in it where the grin did 
    <br>not appear, and where it was dangerous to refer to the ex-convict’s letter.

    <br>an imaginary person. The burglar Williams—Harvard graduate, son of a 
    <br>minister—wrote the letter himself, to himself: got it smuggled out of the 
    <br>prison; got it conveyed to persons who had supported and encouraged 
    <br>him in his conversion—where he knew two things would happen: the 
    <br>genuineness of the letter would not be doubted or inquired into; and the 
    <br>nub of it would be noticed, and would have valuable effect—the effect, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">indeed, of starting a movement to get Mr. Williams pardoned out of 
    <br>prison.

    <br>not hunt for Mr. Brown; for, alas! the investigations of long ago had 
    <br>proved that the benevolent Brown, like ‘Jack Hunt,’ was not a real

    <br>Missouri, a sleepy village in my day, but a brisk railway center now; 
    <br>however, all the towns out there are railway centers now. I could not 
    <br>clearly recognize the place. This seemed odd to me, for when I retired 
    <br>from the rebel army in ‘61 I retired upon Louisiana in good order; at least 
    <br>in good enough order for a person who had not yet learned how to 
    <br>retreat according to the rules of war, and had to trust to native genius. It 
    <br>seemed to me that for a first attempt at a retreat it was not badly done. I 
    <br>had done no advancing in all that campaign that was at all equal to it.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">another glimpse six years earlier, but both were so brief that they hardly 
    <br>counted. The only notion of the town that remained in my mind was the 
    <br>memory of it as I had known it when I first quitted it twenty-nine years 
    <br>ago. That picture of it was still as clear and vivid to me as a photograph. I 
    <br>stepped ashore with the feeling of one who returns out of a dead-and-
    <br>gone generation. I had a sort of realizing sense of what the Bastille 
    <br>prisoners must have felt when they used to come out and look upon Paris 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">after years of captivity, and note how curiously the familiar and the

    <br>through the vacant streets, still seeing the town as it was, and not as it is, 
    <br>and recognizing and metaphorically shaking hands with a hundred 
    <br>familiar objects which no longer exist; and finally climbed Holiday’s Hill 
    <br>to get a comprehensive view. The whole town lay spread out below me 
    <br>then, and I could mark and fix every locality, every detail. Naturally, I 
    <br>was a good deal moved. I said, ‘Many of the people I once knew in this 
    <br>tranquil refuge of my childhood are now in heaven; some, I trust, are in 
    <br>the other place.’ The things about me and before me made me feel like a 
    <br>boy again—convinced me that I was a boy again, and that I had simply 
    <br>been dreaming an unusually long dream; but my reflections spoiled all 
    <br>that; for they forced me to say, ‘I see fifty old houses down yonder, into 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">each of which I could enter and find either a man or a woman who was a 
    <br>baby or unborn when I noticed those houses last, or a grandmother who 
    <br>was a plump young bride at that time.’

    <br>wide over the wooded expanses of Illinois, is very beautiful—one of the 
    <br>most beautiful on the Mississippi, I think; which is a hazardous remark 
    <br>to make, for the eight hundred miles of river between St. Louis and St. 
    <br>Paul afford an unbroken succession of lovely pictures. It may be that my 
    <br>affection for the one in question biases my judgment in its favor; I 
    <br>cannot say as to that. No matter, it was satisfyingly beautiful to me, and 
    <br>it had this advantage over all the other friends whom I was about to greet 
    <br>again: it had suffered no change; it was as young and fresh and comely 
    <br>and gracious as ever it had been; whereas, the faces of the others would 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">be old, and scarred with the campaigns of life, and marked with their 
    <br>griefs and defeats, and would give me no upliftings of spirit.

    <br>discussed the weather, and then drifted into other matters. I could not 
    <br>remember his face. He said he had been living here twenty-eight years. 
    <br>So he had come after my time, and I had never seen him before. I asked 
    <br>him various questions; first about a mate of mine in Sunday school—

    <br>not needed the information, delivered from the pulpit that evening, that 
    <br>Lem’s was a case of special judgment—we knew that, already. There was 
    <br>a ferocious thunder-storm, that night, and it raged continuously until 
    <br>near dawn. The winds blew, the windows rattled, the rain swept along 
    <br>the roof in pelting sheets, and at the briefest of intervals the inky 
    <br>blackness of the night vanished, the houses over the way glared out white 
    <br>and blinding for a quivering instant, then the solid darkness shut down 
    <br>again and a splitting peal of thunder followed, which seemed to rend 
    <br>everything in the neighborhood to shreds and splinters. I sat up in bed 
    <br>quaking and shuddering, waiting for the destruction of the world, and 
    <br>expecting it. To me there was nothing strange or incongruous in heaven’s 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">making such an uproar about Lem Hackett. Apparently it was the right 
    <br>and proper thing to do. Not a doubt entered my mind that all the angels 
    <br>were grouped together, discussing this boy’s case and observing the 
    <br>awful bombardment of our beggarly little village with satisfaction and 
    <br>approval. There was one thing which disturbed me in the most serious 
    <br>way; that was the thought that this centering of the celestial interest on 
    <br>our village could not fail to attract the attention of the observers to 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice for years. I 
    <br>felt that I was not only one of those people, but the very one most likely

    <br>the fire with Lem before the chill of the river had been fairly warmed out 
    <br>of him. I knew that this would be only just and fair. I was increasing the 
    <br>chances against myself all the time, by feeling a secret bitterness against 
    <br>Lem for having attracted this fatal attention to me, but I could not help 
    <br>it—this sinful thought persisted in infesting my breast in spite of me. 
    <br>Every time the lightning glared I caught my breath, and judged I was 
    <br>gone. In my terror and misery, I meanly began to suggest other boys, and 
    <br>mention acts of theirs which were wickeder than mine, and peculiarly 
    <br>needed punishment—and I tried to pretend to myself that I was simply 
    <br>doing this in a casual way, and without intent to divert the heavenly 
    <br>attention to them for the purpose of getting rid of it myself. With deep 
    <br>sagacity I put these mentions into the form of sorrowing recollections 
    <br>and left-handed sham-supplications that the sins of those boys might be 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">allowed to pass unnoticed—‘Possibly they may repent.’ ‘It is true that Jim 
    <br>Smith broke a window and lied about it—but maybe he did not mean any 
    <br>harm. And although Tom Holmes says more bad words than any other 
    <br>boy in the village, he probably intends to repent—though he has never 
    <br>said he would. And whilst it is a fact that John Jones did fish a little on 
    <br>Sunday, once, he didn’t really catch anything but only just one small 
    <br>useless mud-cat; and maybe that wouldn’t have been so awful if he had 
    <br>thrown it back—as he says he did, but he didn’t. Pity but they would 
    <br>repent of these dreadful things—and maybe they will yet.’

    <br>who were doubtless directing the celestial attention to me at the same 
    <br>moment, though I never once suspected that—I had heedlessly left my 
    <br>candle burning. It was not a time to neglect even trifling precautions. 
    <br>There was no occasion to add anything to the facilities for attracting 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">notice to me—so I put the light out.

    <br>that they had been set down against me in a book by an angel who was 
    <br>wiser than I and did not trust such important matters to memory. It 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">struck me, by and by, that I had been making a most foolish and

    <br>instantly; I also resolved to connect myself with the church the next day, 
    <br>if I survived to see its sun appear. I resolved to cease from sin in all its 
    <br>forms, and to lead a high and blameless life for ever after. I would be 
    <br>punctual at church and Sunday-school; visit the sick; carry baskets of 
    <br>victuals to the poor (simply to fulfil the regulation conditions, although I 
    <br>knew we had none among us so poor but they would smash the basket 
    <br>over my head for my pains); I would instruct other boys in right ways, 
    <br>and take the resulting trouncings meekly; I would subsist entirely on 
    <br>tracts; I would invade the rum shop and warn the drunkard— and finally, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">if I escaped the fate of those who early become too good to live, I would 
    <br>go for a missionary.

    <br>a sense of obligation to Lem Hackett for going to eternal suffering in that 
    <br>abrupt way, and thus preventing a far more dreadful disaster—my own 
    <br>loss.

    <br>were still alive, I had a dim sense that perhaps the whole thing was a 
    <br>false alarm; that the entire turmoil had been on Lem’s account and 
    <br>nobody’s else. The world looked so bright and safe that there did not 
    <br>seem to be any real occasion to turn over a new leaf. I was a little 
    <br>subdued, during that day, and perhaps the next; after that, my purpose 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of reforming slowly dropped out of my mind, and I had a peaceful, 
    <br>comfortable time again, until the next storm.

    <br>unaccountable one, to me, that I had ever experienced; for on the 
    <br>afternoon of that day, ‘Dutchy’ was drowned. Dutchy belonged to our 
    <br>Sunday-school. He was a German lad who did not know enough to come 
    <br>in out of the rain; but he was exasperatingly good, and had a prodigious 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">memory. One Sunday he made himself the envy of all the youth and the

    <br>bathing in a muddy creek which had a deep hole in it, and in this hole the 
    <br>coopers had sunk a pile of green hickory hoop poles to soak, some twelve 
    <br>feet under water. We were diving and ‘seeing who could stay under 
    <br>longest.’ We managed to remain down by holding on to the hoop poles. 
    <br>Dutchy made such a poor success of it that he was hailed with laughter 
    <br>and derision every time his head appeared above water. At last he 
    <br>seemed hurt with the taunts, and begged us to stand still on the bank and 
    <br>be fair with him and give him an honest count—‘be friendly and kind just 
    <br>this once, and not miscount for the sake of having the fun of laughing at 
    <br>him.’ Treacherous winks were exchanged, and all said ‘All right, 
    <br>Dutchy—go ahead, we’ll play fair.’

    <br>the lead of one of their number and scampered to a range of blackberry 
    <br>bushes close by and hid behind it. They imagined Dutchy’s humiliation, 
    <br>when he should rise after a superhuman effort and find the place silent 
    <br>and vacant, nobody there to applaud. They were ‘so full of laugh’ with the 
    <br>idea, that they were continually exploding into muffled cackles. Time 
    <br>swept on, and presently one who was peeping through the briers, said, 
    <br>with surprise—

    <br>the placid water. Hearts began to beat fast, and faces to turn pale. We all 
    <br>glided out, silently, and stood on the bank, our horrified eyes wandering

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">putting on anybody’s that came handy, and getting them wrong-side-out 
    <br>and upside-down, as a rule. Then we scurried away and gave the alarm, 
    <br>but none of us went back to see the end of the tragedy. We had a more 
    <br>important thing to attend to: we all flew home, and lost not a moment in 
    <br>getting ready to lead a better life.

    <br>utterly unaccountable storm. I was perfectly dazed; I could not 
    <br>understand it. It seemed to me that there must be some mistake. The 
    <br>elements were turned loose, and they rattled and banged and blazed 
    <br>away in the most blind and frantic manner. All heart and hope went out 
    <br>of me, and the dismal thought kept floating through my brain, ‘If a boy 
    <br>who knows three thousand verses by heart is not satisfactory, what 
    <br>chance is there for anybody else?’

    <br>Dutchy’s account, or that he or any other inconsequential animal was 
    <br>worthy of such a majestic demonstration from on high; the lesson of it 
    <br>was the only thing that troubled me; for it convinced me that if Dutchy, 
    <br>with all his perfections, was not a delight, it would be vain for me to turn 
    <br>over a new leaf, for I must infallibly fall hopelessly short of that boy, no 
    <br>matter how hard I might try. Nevertheless I did turn it over—a highly

    <br>with their progenitors who had sat with me in those places and had 
    <br>probably taken me as a model—though I do not remember as to that 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">now. By the public square there had been in my day a shabby little brick 
    <br>church called the ‘Old Ship of Zion,’ which I had attended as a Sunday-
    <br>school scholar; and I found the locality easily enough, but not the old 
    <br>church; it was gone, and a trig and rather hilarious new edifice was in its 
    <br>place. The pupils were better dressed and better looking than were those 
    <br>of my time; consequently they did not resemble their ancestors; and 
    <br>consequently there was nothing familiar to me in their faces. Still, I 
    <br>contemplated them with a deep interest and a yearning wistfulness, and 
    <br>if I had been a girl I would have cried; for they were the offspring, and 
    <br>represented, and occupied the places, of boys and girls some of whom I 
    <br>had loved to love, and some of whom I had loved to hate, but all of whom 
    <br>were dear to me for the one reason or the other, so many years gone by—
    <br>and, Lord, where be they now!

    <br>on that spot in the early ages, recognized me, and I talked a flutter of 
    <br>wild nonsense to those children to hide the thoughts which were in me,

    <br>look at the scholars. On the spur of the moment I could not recall any of 
    <br>the old idiotic talks which visitors used to insult me with when I was a 
    <br>pupil there; and I was sorry for this, since it would have given me time 
    <br>and excuse to dawdle there and take a long and satisfying look at what I 
    <br>feel at liberty to say was an array of fresh young comeliness not 
    <br>matchable in another Sunday-school of the same size. As I talked merely 
    <br>to get a chance to inspect; and as I strung out the random rubbish solely 
    <br>to prolong the inspection, I judged it but decent to confess these low 
    <br>motives, and I did so.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">piety, perfect in exterior godliness; but at bottom he was a prig; and as 
    <br>for the contents of his skull, they could have changed place with the 
    <br>contents of a pie and nobody would have been the worse off for it but the 
    <br>pie. This fellow’s reproachlessness was a standing reproach to every lad 
    <br>in the village. He was the admiration of all the mothers, and the 
    <br>detestation of all their sons. I was told what became of him, but as it was 
    <br>a disappointment to me, I will not enter into details. He succeeded in 
    <br>life.

    <br>the young ladies I had in mind—sometimes their grand-daughters. When 
    <br>you are told that a stranger of fifty is a grandmother, there is nothing 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">surprising about it; but if, on the contrary, she is a person whom you 
    <br>knew as a little girl, it seems impossible. You say to yourself, ‘How can a

    <br>the fact that while you have been growing old, your friends have not been 
    <br>standing still, in that matter.

    <br>be good.

    <br>Saturday holidays; in fact I spent the summer with him—all of it which 
    <br>was valuable to me. His fascinations never diminished, for he threw 
    <br>something fresh and stirring, in the way of horror, into each successive 
    <br>murder. He always gave names, dates, places—everything. This by and 
    <br>by enabled me to note two things: that he had killed his victims in every 
    <br>quarter of the globe, and that these victims were always named Lynch. 
    <br>The destruction of the Lynches went serenely on, Saturday after 
    <br>Saturday, until the original thirty had multiplied to sixty—and more to 
    <br>be heard from yet; then my curiosity got the better of my timidity, and I 
    <br>asked how it happened that these justly punished persons all bore the 
    <br>same name.

    <br>and she had reciprocated ‘with all the sweet affection of her pure and 
    <br>noble nature.’ But he had a rival, a ‘base hireling’ named Archibald 
    <br>Lynch, who said the girl should be his, or he would ‘dye his hands in her 
    <br>heart’s best blood.’ The carpenter, ‘innocent and happy in love’s young 
    <br>dream,’ gave no weight to the threat, but led his ‘golden-haired darling to 
    <br>the altar,’ and there, the two were made one; there also, just as the 
    <br>minister’s hands were stretched in blessing over their heads, the fell deed 
    <br>was done—with a knife—and the bride fell a corpse at her husband’s feet. 
    <br>And what did the husband do? He plucked forth that knife, and kneeling 
    <br>by the body of his lost one, swore to ‘consecrate his life to the 
    <br>extermination of all the human scum that bear the hated name of Lynch.’

    <br>aged fourteen. The body of this poor child was put into a copper cylinder 
    <br>filled with alcohol, and this was suspended in one of the dismal avenues 
    <br>of the cave. The top of the cylinder was removable; and it was said to be a

    <br>small jail (or ‘calaboose’) which once stood in its neighborhood. A citizen 
    <br>asked, ‘Do you remember when Jimmy Finn, the town drunkard, was 
    <br>burned to death in the calaboose?’ 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:284801px; width:452px; height:526px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Observe, now, how history becomes defiled, through lapse of time and 
    <br>the help of the bad memories of men. Jimmy Finn was not burned in the 
    <br>calaboose, but died a natural death in a tan vat, of a combination of 
    <br>delirium tremens and spontaneous combustion. When I say natural 
    <br>death, I mean it was a natural death for Jimmy Finn to die. The 
    <br>calaboose victim was not a citizen; he was a poor stranger, a harmless 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">whiskey-sodden tramp. I know more about his case than anybody else; I 
    <br>knew too much of it, in that bygone day, to relish speaking of it. That 
    <br>tramp was wandering about the streets one chilly evening, with a pipe in 
    <br>his mouth, and begging for a match; he got neither matches nor 
    <br>courtesy; on the contrary, a troop of bad little boys followed him around 
    <br>and amused themselves with nagging and annoying him. I assisted; but 
    <br>at last, some appeal which the wayfarer made for forbearance, 
    <br>accompanying it with a pathetic reference to his forlorn and friendless 
    <br>condition, touched such sense of shame and remnant of right feeling as 
    <br>were left in me, and I went away and got him some matches, and then 
    <br>hied me home and to bed, heavily weighted as to conscience, and 
    <br>unbuoyant in spirit. An hour or two afterward, the man was arrested and 
    <br>locked up in the calaboose by the marshal—large name for a constable, 
    <br>but that was his title. At two in the morning, the church bells rang for 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">fire, and everybody turned out, of course—I with the rest. The tramp had 
    <br>used his matches disastrously: he had set his straw bed on fire, and the 
    <br>oaken sheathing of the room had caught. When I reached the ground, 
    <br>two hundred men, women, and children stood massed together, 
    <br>transfixed with horror, and staring at the grated windows of the jail. 
    <br>Behind the iron bars, and tugging frantically at them, and screaming for 
    <br>help, stood the tramp; he seemed like a black object set against a sun, so 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">white and intense was the light at his back. That marshal could not be 
    <br>found, and he had the only key. A battering-ram was quickly improvised,

    <br>that the spectators broke into wild cheering, and believed the merciful

    <br>yield. It was said that the man’s death-grip still held fast to the bars after 
    <br>he was dead; and that in this position the fires wrapped him about and 
    <br>consumed him. As to this, I do not know. What was seen after I

    <br>into my memory, and the study of them entertains me as much now as 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">they themselves distressed me then. If anybody spoke of that grisly 
    <br>matter, I was all ears in a moment, and alert to hear what might be said, 
    <br>for I was always dreading and expecting to find out that I was suspected; 
    <br>and so fine and so delicate was the perception of my guilty conscience, 
    <br>that it often detected suspicion in the most purposeless remarks, and in 
    <br>looks, gestures, glances of the eye which had no significance, but which 
    <br>sent me shivering away in a panic of fright, just the same. And how sick it 
    <br>made me when somebody dropped, howsoever carelessly and barren of 
    <br>intent, the remark that ‘murder will out!’ For a boy of ten years, I was 
    <br>carrying a pretty weighty cargo.

    <br>he was much talked of when I lived there. This is what was said of him—

    <br>the curbstones of Keokuk. He would sit down on a curbstone with his 
    <br>book, careless or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and the tramp 
    <br>of the passing crowds, and bury himself in his studies by the hour, never 
    <br>changing his position except to draw in his knees now and then to let a 
    <br>dray pass unobstructed; and when his book was finished, its contents, 
    <br>however abstruse, had been burnt into his memory, and were his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">permanent possession. In this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts of 
    <br>learning, and had it pigeon-holed in his head where he could put his 
    <br>intellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted.

    <br>His theme was always politics. He used no notes, for a volcano does not

    <br>meeting was to be held on a certain day in the new Athenaeum. A 
    <br>distinguished stranger was to address the house. After the building had 
    <br>been packed to its utmost capacity with sweltering folk of both sexes, the 
    <br>stage still remained vacant—the distinguished stranger had failed to 
    <br>connect. The crowd grew impatient, and by and by indignant and 
    <br>rebellious. About this time a distressed manager discovered Dean on a 
    <br>curb-stone, explained the dilemma to him, took his book away from him, 
    <br>rushed him into the building the back way, and told him to make for the 
    <br>stage and save his country.

    <br>everybody’s eyes sought a single point—the wide, empty, carpetless 
    <br>stage. A figure appeared there whose aspect was familiar to hardly a 
    <br>dozen persons present. It was the scarecrow Dean—in foxy shoes, down 
    <br>at the heels; socks of odd colors, also ‘down;’ damaged trousers, relics of 
    <br>antiquity, and a world too short, exposing some inches of naked ankle; 
    <br>an unbuttoned vest, also too short, and exposing a zone of soiled and 
    <br>wrinkled linen between it and the waistband; shirt bosom open; long 
    <br>black handkerchief, wound round and round the neck like a bandage; 
    <br>bob-tailed blue coat, reaching down to the small of the back, with sleeves 
    <br>which left four inches of forearm unprotected; small, stiff-brimmed 
    <br>soldier-cap hung on a corner of the bump of—whichever bump it was. 
    <br>This figure moved gravely out upon the stage and, with sedate and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">measured step, down to the front, where it paused, and dreamily 
    <br>inspected the house, saying no word. The silence of surprise held its own 
    <br>for a moment, then was broken by a just audible ripple of merriment 
    <br>which swept the sea of faces like the wash of a wave. The figure remained 
    <br>as before, thoughtfully inspecting. Another wave started—laughter, this 
    <br>time. It was followed by another, then a third—this last one boisterous.

    <br>from the boat. I lived there awhile, many years ago, but the place, now, 
    <br>had a rather unfamiliar look; so I suppose it has clear outgrown the town 
    <br>which I used to know. In fact, I know it has; for I remember it as a small 
    <br>place—which it isn’t now. But I remember it best for a lunatic who 
    <br>caught me out in the fields, one Sunday, and extracted a butcher-knife 
    <br>from his boot and proposed to carve me up with it, unless I 
    <br>acknowledged him to be the only son of the Devil. I tried to compromise 
    <br>on an acknowledgment that he was the only member of the family I had 
    <br>met; but that did not satisfy him; he wouldn’t have any half-measures; I 
    <br>must say he was the sole and only son of the Devil—he whetted his knife 
    <br>on his boot. It did not seem worth while to make trouble about a little 
    <br>thing like that; so I swung round to his view of the matter and saved my 
    <br>skin whole. Shortly afterward, he went to visit his father; and as he has 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">not turned up since, I trust he is there yet.

    <br>sunsets. I have never seen any, on either side of the ocean, that equaled 
    <br>them. They used the broad smooth river as a canvas, and painted on it 
    <br>every imaginable dream of color, from the mottled daintinesses and 
    <br>delicacies of the opal, all the way up, through cumulative intensities, to 
    <br>blinding purple and crimson conflagrations which were enchanting to 
    <br>the eye, but sharply tried it at the same time. All the Upper Mississippi 
    <br>region has these extraordinary sunsets as a familiar spectacle. It is the 
    <br>true Sunset Land: I am sure no other country can show so good a right to 
    <br>the name. The sunrises are also said to be exceedingly fine. I do not 
    <br>know.

    <br>a college, a library, and a newspaper; and they live under law. Solicitude

    <br>By what it has accomplished while still teething, one may forecast what 
    <br>marvels it will do in the strength of its maturity. It is so new that the 
    <br>foreign tourist has not heard of it yet; and has not visited it. For sixty 
    <br>years, the foreign tourist has steamed up and down the river between St. 
    <br>Louis and New Orleans, and then gone home and written his book, 
    <br>believing he had seen all of the river that was worth seeing or that had 
    <br>anything to see. In not six of all these books is there mention of these 
    <br>Upper River towns—for the reason that the five or six tourists who 
    <br>penetrated this region did it before these towns were projected. The 
    <br>latest tourist of them all (1878) made the same old regulation trip—he 
    <br>had not heard that there was anything north of St. Louis.

    <br>projected day before yesterday, so to speak, and built next morning. A

    <br>this region, that I, who am comparatively young, am yet older than it is. 
    <br>When I was born, St. Paul had a population of three persons, 
    <br>Minneapolis had just a third as many. The then population of 
    <br>Minneapolis died two years ago; and when he died he had seen himself 
    <br>undergo an increase, in forty years, of fifty-nine thousand nine hundred 
    <br>and ninety-nine persons. He had a frog’s fertility.

    <br>Paul and Minneapolis, are several months old. These towns are far larger 
    <br>now. In fact, I have just seen a newspaper estimate which gives the 
    <br>former seventy-one thousand, and the latter seventy-eight thousand. 
    <br>This book will not reach the public for six or seven months yet; none of 
    <br>the figures will be worth much then.

    <br>crowning a hill—a phrase which applies to all these towns; for they are 
    <br>all comely, all well built, clean, orderly, pleasant to the eye, and cheering 
    <br>to the spirit; and they are all situated upon hills. Therefore we will give 
    <br>that phrase a rest. The Indians have a tradition that Marquette and Joliet 
    <br>camped where Davenport now stands, in 1673. The next white man who 
    <br>camped there, did it about a hundred and seventy years later—in 1834. 
    <br>Davenport has gathered its thirty thousand people within the past thirty 
    <br>years. She sends more children to her schools now, than her whole 
    <br>population numbered twenty-three years ago. She has the usual Upper 
    <br>River quota of factories, newspapers, and institutions of learning; she 
    <br>has telephones, local telegraphs, an electric alarm, and an admirable 
    <br>paid fire department, consisting of six hook and ladder companies, four 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">steam fire engines, and thirty churches. Davenport is the official 
    <br>residence of two bishops—Episcopal and Catholic.

    <br>region. The lead mines are very productive, and of wide extent. Dubuque 
    <br>has a great number of manufacturing establishments; among them a 
    <br>plow factory which has for customers all Christendom in general. At least 
    <br>so I was told by an agent of the concern who was on the boat. He said—

    <br>Hawk’s was once a puissant name hereabouts; as was Keokuk’s, further 
    <br>down. A few miles below Dubuque is the Tete de Mort—Death’s-head 
    <br>rock, or bluff—to the top of which the French drove a band of Indians, in 
    <br>early times, and cooped them up there, with death for a certainty, and 
    <br>only the manner of it matter of choice—to starve, or jump off and kill 
    <br>themselves. Black Hawk adopted the ways of the white people, toward 
    <br>the end of his life; and when he died he was buried, near Des Moines, in 
    <br>Christian fashion, modified by Indian custom; that is to say, clothed in a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Christian military uniform, and with a Christian cane in his hand, but 
    <br>deposited in the grave in a sitting posture. Formerly, a horse had always 
    <br>been buried with a chief. The substitution of the cane shows that Black 
    <br>Hawk’s haughty nature was really humbled, and he expected to walk 
    <br>when he got over.

    <br>judiciously stopped there. Why? Because the impression left, was that 
    <br>these tales were full of incident and imagination—a pleasant impression 
    <br>which would be promptly dissipated if the tales were told. I showed him 
    <br>a lot of this sort of literature which I had been collecting, and he 
    <br>confessed that it was poor stuff, exceedingly sorry rubbish; and I 
    <br>ventured to add that the legends which he had himself told us were of 
    <br>this character, with the single exception of the admirable story of 
    <br>Winona. He granted these facts, but said that if I would hunt up Mr. 
    <br>Schoolcraft’s book, published near fifty years ago, and now doubtless out 
    <br>of print, I would find some Indian inventions in it that were very far from 
    <br>being barren of incident and imagination; that the tales in Hiawatha 
    <br>were of this sort, and they came from Schoolcraft’s book; and that there 
    <br>were others in the same book which Mr. Longfellow could have turned 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">into verse with good effect. For instance, there was the legend of ‘The 
    <br>Undying Head.’ He could not tell it, for many of the details had grown 
    <br>dim in his memory; but he would recommend me to find it and enlarge 
    <br>my respect for the Indian imagination. He said that this tale, and most of 
    <br>the others in the book, were current among the Indians along this part of 
    <br>the Mississippi when he first came here; and that the contributors to 
    <br>Schoolcraft’s book had got them directly from Indian lips, and had 
    <br>written them down with strict exactness, and without embellishments of 
    <br>their own.

    <br>in it which confirm what he said. I will offer two of them—‘The Undying 
    <br>Head,’ and ‘Peboan and Seegwun, an Allegory of the Seasons.’ The latter 
    <br>is used in Hiawatha; but it is worth reading in the original form, if only

    <br>about a ten-day trip by steamer. It can probably be done quicker by rail. I 
    <br>judge so because I know that one may go by rail from St. Louis to 
    <br>Hannibal—a distance of at least a hundred and twenty miles—in seven 
    <br>hours. This is better than walking; unless one is in a hurry.

    <br>together in solid blocks of honest brick and stone, and has the air of 
    <br>intending to stay. Its post-office was established thirty-six years ago; and 
    <br>by and by, when the postmaster received a letter, he carried it to 
    <br>Washington, horseback, to inquire what was to be done with it. Such is 
    <br>the legend. Two frame houses were built that year, and several persons 
    <br>were added to the population. A recent number of the leading St. Paul 
    <br>paper, the ‘Pioneer Press,’ gives some statistics which furnish a vivid 
    <br>contrast to that old state of things, to wit: Population, autumn of the 
    <br>present year (1882), 71,000; number of letters handled, first half of the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">year, 1,209,387; number of houses built during three-quarters of the 
    <br>year, 989; their cost, $3,186,000. The increase of letters over the 
    <br>corresponding six months of last year was fifty per cent. Last year the 
    <br>new buildings added to the city cost above $4,500,000. St. Paul’s 
    <br>strength lies in her commerce—I mean his commerce. He is a 
    <br>manufacturing city, of course—all the cities of that region are—but he is 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">peculiarly strong in the matter of commerce. Last year his jobbing trade 
    <br>amounted to upwards of $52,000,000.

    <br>of red men, an island in the middle of White-bear Lake has been visited 
    <br>by a band of Indians for the purpose of making maple sugar.

    <br>warrior loved and wooed the daughter of his chief, and it is said, also, the 
    <br>maiden loved the warrior. He had again and again been refused her hand 
    <br>by her parents, the old chief alleging that he was no brave, and his old 
    <br>consort called him a woman! 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:309787px; width:454px; height:526px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The sun had again set upon the ‘sugar-bush,’ and the bright moon rose 
    <br>high in the bright blue heavens, when the young warrior took down his 
    <br>flute and went out alone, once more to sing the story of his love, the mild 
    <br>breeze gently moved the two gay feathers in his head-dress, and as he 
    <br>mounted on the trunk of a leaning tree, the damp snow fell from his feet 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">heavily. As he raised his flute to his lips, his blanket slipped from his 
    <br>well-formed shoulders, and lay partly on the snow beneath. He began his 
    <br>weird, wild love-song, but soon felt that he was cold, and as he reached 
    <br>back for his blanket, some unseen hand laid it gently on his shoulders; it 
    <br>was the hand of his love, his guardian angel. She took her place beside 
    <br>him, and for the present they were happy; for the Indian has a heart to 
    <br>love, and in this pride he is as noble as in his own freedom, which makes 
    <br>him the child of the forest. As the legend runs, a large white-bear, 
    <br>thinking, perhaps, that polar snows and dismal winter weather extended 
    <br>everywhere, took up his journey southward. He at length approached the 
    <br>northern shore of the lake which now bears his name, walked down the 
    <br>bank and made his way noiselessly through the deep heavy snow toward 
    <br>the island. It was the same spring ensuing that the lovers met. They had 
    <br>left their first retreat, and were now seated among the branches of a large 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">elm which hung far over the lake. (The same tree is still standing, and 
    <br>excites universal curiosity and interest.) For fear of being detected, they 
    <br>talked almost in a whisper, and now, that they might get back to camp in 
    <br>good time and thereby avoid suspicion, they were just rising to return, 
    <br>when the maiden uttered a shriek which was heard at the camp, and 
    <br>bounding toward the young brave, she caught his blanket, but missed the 
    <br>direction of her foot and fell, bearing the blanket with her into the great 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">arms of the ferocious monster. Instantly every man, woman, and child of 
    <br>the band were upon the bank, but all unarmed. Cries and wailings went 
    <br>up from every mouth. What was to be done’? In the meantime this white

    <br>fondled with his precious prey as if he were used to scenes like this. One 
    <br>deafening yell from the lover warrior is heard above the cries of 
    <br>hundreds of his tribe, and dashing away to his wigwam he grasps his 
    <br>faithful knife, returns almost at a single bound to the scene of fear and 
    <br>fright, rushes out along the leaning tree to the spot where his treasure 
    <br>fell, and springing with the fury of a mad panther, pounced upon his 
    <br>prey. The animal turned, and with one stroke of his huge paw brought 
    <br>the lovers heart to heart, but the next moment the warrior, with one 
    <br>plunge of the blade of his knife, opened the crimson sluices of death, and 
    <br>the dying bear relaxed his hold.

    <br>gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">moon had set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children 
    <br>for many years played upon the skin of the white-bear—from which the 
    <br>lake derives its name—and the maiden and the brave remembered long 
    <br>the fearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and

    <br>the blanket; and the bear caught her and fondled her—her and the 
    <br>blanket; then she fell up into the tree again—leaving the blanket; 
    <br>meantime the lover goes war-whooping home and comes back ‘heeled,’ 
    <br>climbs the tree, jumps down on the bear, the girl jumps down after him—
    <br>apparently, for she was up the tree—resumes her place in the bear’s arms 
    <br>along with the blanket, the lover rams his knife into the bear, and saves—
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">whom, the blanket? No—nothing of the sort. You get yourself all worked 
    <br>up and excited about that blanket, and then all of a sudden, just when a 
    <br>happy climax seems imminent you are let down flat—nothing saved but 
    <br>the girl. Whereas, one is not interested in the girl; she is not the 
    <br>prominent feature of the legend. Nevertheless, there you are left, and 
    <br>there you must remain; for if you live a thousand years you will never 
    <br>know who got the blanket. A dead man could get up a better legend than 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">this one. I don’t mean a fresh dead man either; I mean a man that’s been 
    <br>dead weeks and weeks.

    <br>Mississippi and entered Old River, or what is now called the mouth of 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">the Red. Ascending on the left, a flood was pouring in through and over 
    <br>the levees on the Chandler plantation, the most northern point in Pointe 
    <br>Coupee parish. The water completely covered the place, although the 
    <br>levees had given way but a short time before. The stock had been 
    <br>gathered in a large flat-boat, where, without food, as we passed, the 
    <br>animals were huddled together, waiting for a boat to tow them off. On 
    <br>the right-hand side of the river is Turnbull’s Island, and on it is a large 
    <br>plantation which formerly was pronounced one of the most fertile in the 
    <br>State. The water has hitherto allowed it to go scot-free in usual floods, 
    <br>but now broad sheets of water told only where fields were. The top of the 
    <br>protecting levee could be seen here and there, but nearly all of it was 
    <br>submerged.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and the woods look bright and fresh, but this pleasant aspect to the eye is 
    <br>neutralized by the interminable waste of water. We pass mile after mile, 
    <br>and it is nothing but trees standing up to their branches in water. A 
    <br>water-turkey now and again rises and flies ahead into the long avenue of 
    <br>silence. A pirogue sometimes flits from the bushes and crosses the Red 
    <br>River on its way out to the Mississippi, but the sad-faced paddlers never 
    <br>turn their heads to look at our boat. The puffing of the boat is music in 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">this gloom, which affects one most curiously. It is not the gloom of deep 
    <br>forests or dark caverns, but a peculiar kind of solemn silence and

    <br>evidently of the well-to-do class, as they had a supply of meal and three 
    <br>or four hogs with them. Their rafts were about twenty feet square, and in 
    <br>front of an improvised shelter earth had been placed, on which they built 
    <br>their fire.

    <br>Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction, which needs only to 
    <br>be seen to enforce the opinion of that river’s desperate endeavors to find 
    <br>a short way to the Gulf. Small boats, skiffs, pirogues, etc., are in great 
    <br>demand, and many have been stolen by piratical negroes, who take them 
    <br>where they will bring the greatest price. From what was told me by Mr. 
    <br>C. P. Ferguson, a planter near Red River Landing, whose place has just 
    <br>gone under, there is much suffering in the rear of that place. The negroes 
    <br>had given up all thoughts of a crevasse there, as the upper levee had 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">stood so long, and when it did come they were at its mercy. On Thursday 
    <br>a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and brought in, 
    <br>many yet remaining.

    <br>flood. At sea one does not expect or look for it, but here, with fluttering 
    <br>leaves, shadowy forest aisles, house-tops barely visible, it is expected. In 
    <br>fact a grave-yard, if the mounds were above water, would be appreciated. 
    <br>The river here is known only because there is an opening in the trees, 
    <br>and that is all. It is in width, from Fort Adams on the left bank of the 
    <br>Mississippi to the bank of Rapides Parish, a distance of about sixty miles. 
    <br>A large portion of this was under cultivation, particularly along the 
    <br>Mississippi and back of the Red. When Red River proper was entered, a 
    <br>strong current was running directly across it, pursuing the same 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">direction as that of the Mississippi.

    <br>entered before signs of suffering became visible. All the willows along the 
    <br>banks were stripped of their leaves. One man, whom your correspondent 
    <br>spoke to, said that he had had one hundred and fifty head of cattle and 
    <br>one hundred head of hogs. At the first appearance of water he had 
    <br>started to drive them to the high lands of Avoyelles, thirty-five miles off, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">but he lost fifty head of the beef cattle and sixty hogs. Black River is quite

    <br>feet, and on all sides could be seen, still holding against the strong 
    <br>current, the tops of cabins. Here and there one overturned was 
    <br>surrounded by drift-wood, forming the nucleus of possibly some future 
    <br>island.

    <br>be touched during the expedition, a look-out was kept for a wood-pile. 
    <br>On rounding a point a pirogue, skilfully paddled by a youth, shot out, 
    <br>and in its bow was a girl of fifteen, of fair face, beautiful black eyes, and 
    <br>demure manners. The boy asked for a paper, which was thrown to him, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and the couple pushed their tiny craft out into the swell of the boat.

    <br>smallest little canoe and handled it with all the deftness of an old 
    <br>voyageur. The little one looked more like an Indian than a white child, 
    <br>and laughed when asked if she were afraid. She had been raised in a 
    <br>pirogue and could go anywhere. She was bound out to pick willow leaves 
    <br>for the stock, and she pointed to a house near by with water three inches 
    <br>deep on the floors. At its back door was moored a raft about thirty feet 
    <br>square, with a sort of fence built upon it, and inside of this some sixteen 
    <br>cows and twenty hogs were standing. The family did not complain, 
    <br>except on account of losing their stock, and promptly brought a supply of 
    <br>wood in a flat.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of earth above water, and to the westward for thirty-five miles there is 
    <br>nothing but the river’s flood. Black River had risen during Thursday, the 
    <br>23rd, 1{three-quarters} inches, and was going up at night still. As we 
    <br>progress up the river habitations become more frequent, but are yet still 
    <br>miles apart. Nearly all of them are deserted, and the out-houses floated 
    <br>off. To add to the gloom, almost every living thing seems to have 
    <br>departed, and not a whistle of a bird nor the bark of the squirrel can be 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">heard in this solitude. Sometimes a morose gar will throw his tail aloft 
    <br>and disappear in the river, but beyond this everything is quiet—the quiet 
    <br>of dissolution. Down the river floats now a neatly whitewashed hen-

    <br>had ceased, the puffing of the escaping steam was stilled, and the 
    <br>enveloping silence closed upon us, and such silence it was! Usually in a 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">forest at night one can hear the piping of frogs, the hum of insects, or the 
    <br>dropping of limbs; but here nature was dumb. The dark recesses, those

    <br>the current die away.

    <br>started. The morning was a beautiful one, and the river, which is 
    <br>remarkably straight, put on its loveliest garb. The blossoms of the haw 
    <br>perfumed the air deliciously, and a few birds whistled blithely along the 
    <br>banks. The trees were larger, and the forest seemed of older growth than 
    <br>below. More fields were passed than nearer the mouth, but the same 
    <br>scene presented itself—smoke-houses drifting out in the pastures, negro 
    <br>quarters anchored in confusion against some oak, and the modest 
    <br>residence just showing its eaves above water. The sun came up in a glory 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of carmine, and the trees were brilliant in their varied shades of green. 
    <br>Not a foot of soil is to be seen anywhere, and the water is apparently 
    <br>growing deeper and deeper, for it reaches up to the branches of the 
    <br>largest trees. All along, the bordering willows have been denuded of

    <br>feet under it. The tendency of the current up the Black is toward the

    <br>driven down from toward the Calcasieu country, and the waters of the

    <br>seen more pictures of distress. On the inside of the houses the inmates 
    <br>had built on boxes a scaffold on which they placed the furniture. The 
    <br>bed-posts were sawed off on top, as the ceiling was not more than four 
    <br>feet from the improvised floor. The buildings looked very insecure, and 
    <br>threatened every moment to float off. Near the houses were cattle 
    <br>standing breast high in the water, perfectly impassive. They did not 
    <br>move in their places, but stood patiently waiting for help to come. The 
    <br>sight was a distressing one, and the poor creatures will be sure to die 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">unless speedily rescued. Cattle differ from horses in this peculiar quality. 
    <br>A horse, after finding no relief comes, will swim off in search of food,

    <br>the water and drowns.

    <br>when it reaches this point there is always imminent risk of their being 
    <br>swept away. If this occurs, there will be great loss of life. The General 
    <br>spoke of the gallant work of many of the people in their attempts to save 
    <br>their stock, but thought that fully twenty-five per cent. had perished. 
    <br>Already twenty-five hundred people had received rations from Troy, on 
    <br>Black River, and he had towed out a great many cattle, but a very great 
    <br>quantity remained and were in dire need. The water was now eighteen

    <br>the hills of Catahoula.

    <br>the Ouachita, and on the right the Tensas. These three rivers form the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Black River. Troy, or a portion of it, is situated on and around three large 
    <br>Indian mounds, circular in shape, which rise above the present water 
    <br>about twelve feet. They are about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, 
    <br>and are about two hundred yards apart. The houses are all built between 
    <br>these mounds, and hence are all flooded to a depth of eighteen inches on 
    <br>their floors.

    <br>only points of refuge for miles. When we arrived we found them crowded 
    <br>with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up. They were 
    <br>mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, and cattle. One of these 
    <br>mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard, and to-day we 
    <br>saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones, chewing their 
    <br>cud in contentment, after a meal of corn furnished by General York. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Here, as below, the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the

    <br>branches to the left out of Black, and between it and the Ouachita, is 
    <br>situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly threatened with destruction. 
    <br>It is much lower than Troy, and the water is eight and nine feet deep in 
    <br>the houses. A strong current sweeps through it, and it is remarkable that 
    <br>all of its houses have not gone before. The residents of both Troy and 
    <br>Trinity have been cared for, yet some of their stock have to be furnished 
    <br>with food.

    <br>and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more rapidly. 
    <br>Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to lighten her, 
    <br>and she was headed down stream to relieve those below. At Tom 
    <br>Hooper’s place, a few miles from Troy, a large flat, with about fifty head 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">of stock on board, was taken in tow. The animals were fed, and soon 
    <br>regained some strength. To-day we go on Little River, where the

    <br>York, to bring out what stock could be reached. Going down river a flat in 
    <br>tow was left in a central locality, and from there men poled her back in 
    <br>the rear of plantations, picking up the animals wherever found. In the 
    <br>loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found, and after a gangway 
    <br>was built they were led down into the flat without difficulty. Taking a 
    <br>skiff with the General, your reporter was pulled up to a little house of two 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">rooms, in which the water was standing two feet on the floors. In one of 
    <br>the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of the place, while in 
    <br>the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated on a scaffold raised 
    <br>on the floor. One or two dug-outs were drifting about in the roam ready 
    <br>to be put in service at any time. When the flat was brought up, the side of 
    <br>the house was cut away as the only means of getting the animals out, and 
    <br>the cattle were driven on board the boat. General York, in this as in every 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">case, inquired if the family desired to leave, informing them that Major 
    <br>Burke, of ‘The Times-Democrat,’ has sent the ‘Susie’ up for that purpose.

    <br>all comprehension. Just below, at a point sixteen miles from Troy, 
    <br>information was received that the house of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger, 
    <br>and his family were all in it. We steamed there immediately, and a sad 
    <br>picture was presented. Looking out of the half of the window left above 
    <br>water, was Mrs. Ellis, who is in feeble health, whilst at the door were her 
    <br>seven children, the oldest not fourteen years. One side of the house was 
    <br>given up to the work animals, some twelve head, besides hogs. In the 
    <br>next room the family lived, the water coming within two inches of the 
    <br>bed-rail. The stove was below water, and the cooking was done on a fire 
    <br>on top of it. The house threatened to give way at any moment: one end of 
    <br>it was sinking, and, in fact, the building looked a mere shell. As the boat 
    <br>rounded to, Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out, and General York told him 
    <br>that he had come to his relief; that ‘The Times-Democrat’ boat was at his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">service, and would remove his family at once to the hills, and on Monday 
    <br>a flat would take out his stock, as, until that time, they would be busy. 
    <br>Notwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family were in, 
    <br>Mr. Ellis did not want to leave. He said he thought he would wait until 
    <br>Monday, and take the risk of his house falling. The children around the 
    <br>door looked perfectly contented, seeming to care little for the danger 
    <br>they were in. These are but two instances of the many. After weeks of 
    <br>privation and suffering, people still cling to their houses and leave only 
    <br>when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to build a 
    <br>scaffold on which to stand. It seemed to be incomprehensible, yet the 
    <br>love for the old place was stronger than that for safety. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:319007px; width:447px; height:123px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">After leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the Oswald 
    <br>place. Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where there were 
    <br>fifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they stood on scaffolds, their 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">heads were above the top of the entrance. It was found impossible to get 
    <br>them out without cutting away a portion of the front; and so axes were

    <br>whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of suffering and 
    <br>loss. An old planter, who has lived on the river since 1844, said there 
    <br>never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than one quarter of the 
    <br>stock has been lost. Luckily the people cared first for their work stock, 
    <br>and when they could find it horses and mules were housed in a place of 
    <br>safety. The rise which still continues, and was two inches last night, 
    <br>compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it is that the work of 
    <br>General York is of such a great value. From daylight to late at night he is 
    <br>going this way and that, cheering by his kindly words and directing with 
    <br>calm judgment what is to be done. One unpleasant story, of a certain 
    <br>merchant in New Orleans, is told all along the river. It appears for some 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">years past the planters have been dealing with this individual, and many 
    <br>of them had balances in his hands. When the overflow came they wrote 
    <br>for coffee, for meal, and, in fact, for such little necessities as were 
    <br>required. No response to these letters came, and others were written, 
    <br>and yet these old customers, with plantations under water, were refused 
    <br>even what was necessary to sustain life. It is needless to say he is not 
    <br>popular now on Back River.

    <br>their proneness where undermined to fall across the slope and support 
    <br>the bank secures at some points a fair depth of channel and some degree 
    <br>of permanence, so in the project of the engineer the use of timber and

    <br>under their shelter, and finally slope them back at the angle upon which 
    <br>willows will grow freely. In this work there are many details connected

    <br>a series of settling basins, etc., a description of which would only 
    <br>complicate the conception. Through the larger part of the river works of

    <br>continuous carpets, or twined into wire-netting. This veneering process 
    <br>has been successfully employed on the Missouri River; and in some cases 
    <br>they have so covered themselves with sediments, and have become so 
    <br>overgrown with willows, that they may be regarded as permanent. In

    <br>measure of the resistance of its bed, it is evident that a narrow and deep 
    <br>stream should have less slope, because it has less frictional surface in 
    <br>proportion to capacity; i.e., less perimeter in proportion to area of cross 
    <br>section. The ultimate effect of levees and revetments confining the floods 
    <br>and bringing all the stages of the river into register is to deepen the 
    <br>channel and let down the slope. The first effect of the levees is to raise 
    <br>the surface; but this, by inducing greater velocity of flow, inevitably 
    <br>causes an enlargement of section, and if this enlargement is prevented 
    <br>from being made at the expense of the banks, the bottom must give way 
    <br>and the form of the waterway be so improved as to admit this flow with 
    <br>less rise. The actual experience with levees upon the Mississippi River, 
    <br>with no attempt to hold the banks, has been favorable, and no one can 
    <br>doubt, upon the evidence furnished in the reports of the commission, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">that if the earliest levees had been accompanied by revetment of banks, 
    <br>and made complete, we should have to-day a river navigable at low 
    <br>water, and an adjacent country safe from inundation. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:71px; top:323320px; width:445px; height:142px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Of course it would be illogical to conclude that the constrained river can 
    <br>ever lower its flood slope so as to make levees unnecessary, but it is 
    <br>believed that, by this lateral constraint, the river as a conduit may be so 
    <br>improved in form that even those rare floods which result from the 
    <br>coincident rising of many tributaries will find vent without destroying 
    <br>levees of ordinary height. That the actual capacity of a channel through 
    <br>alluvium depends upon its service during floods has been often shown, 
    <br>but this capacity does not include anomalous, but recurrent, floods.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">propositions have commended themselves only to unthinking minds, 
    <br>and have no support among engineers. Were the river bed cast-iron, a 
    <br>resort to openings for surplus waters might be a necessity; but as the 
    <br>bottom is yielding, and the best form of outlet is a single deep channel, as 
    <br>realizing the least ratio of perimeter to area of cross section, there could 
    <br>not well be a more unphilosophical method of treatment than the 
    <br>multiplication of avenues of escape.

    <br>appearance of Captain Basil Hall’s ‘Travels in North America.’ In fact, it 
    <br>was a sort of moral earthquake, and the vibration it occasioned through 
    <br>the nerves of the republic, from one corner of the Union to the other, was

    <br>room style and state from one end of the Union to the other. He saw the

    <br>mind of his readers a correct impression, at the least cost of pain to the 
    <br>sensitive folks he was writing about. He states his own opinions and 
    <br>feelings, and leaves it to be inferred that he has good grounds for 
    <br>adopting them; but he spares the Americans the bitterness which a detail 
    <br>of the circumstances would have produced.

    <br>been placed, every morning she would go in search, and never fail of 
    <br>finding each stuck through the heart of a deer. She had then only to drag 
    <br>them into the lodge and prepare their food. Thus she lived till she 
    <br>attained womanhood, when one day her brother, whose name was Iamo, 
    <br>said to her: ‘Sister, the time is at hand when you will be ill. Listen to my 
    <br>advice. If you do not, it will probably be the cause of my death. Take the 
    <br>implements with which we kindle our fires. Go some distance from our 
    <br>lodge and build a separate fire. When you are in want of food, I will tell 
    <br>you where to find it. You must cook for yourself, and I will for myself. 
    <br>When you are ill, do not attempt to come near the lodge, or bring any of 
    <br>the utensils you use. Be sure always to fasten to your belt the implements 
    <br>you need, for you do not know when the time will come. As for myself, I 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">must do the best I can.’ His sister promised to obey him in all he had 
    <br>said.

    <br>her lodge, combing her hair. She had just untied the belt to which the 
    <br>implements were fastened, when suddenly the event, to which her 
    <br>brother had alluded, occurred. She ran out of the lodge, but in her haste 
    <br>forgot the belt. Afraid to return, she stood for some time thinking. 
    <br>Finally, she decided to enter the lodge and get it. For, thought she, my 
    <br>brother is not at home, and I will stay but a moment to catch hold of it. 
    <br>She went back. Running in suddenly, she caught hold of it, and was 
    <br>coming out when her brother came in sight. He knew what was the 
    <br>matter. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘did I not tell you to take care. But now you have 
    <br>killed me.’ She was going on her way, but her brother said to her, ‘What 
    <br>can you do there now. The accident has happened. Go in, and stay where 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">you have always stayed. And what will become of you? You have killed

    <br>food. The inflammation continued to increase, and had now reached his 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">first rib; and he said: ‘Sister, my end is near. You must do as I tell you.

    <br>‘Strike,’ said he, and a smile was on his face. Mustering all her courage, 
    <br>she gave the blow and cut off the head. ‘Now,’ said the head, ‘place me 
    <br>where I told you.’ And fearfully she obeyed it in all its commands. 
    <br>Retaining its animation, it looked around the lodge as usual, and it 
    <br>would command its sister to go in such places as it thought would

    <br>and warlike band of Indians. In this village was a family of ten young 
    <br>men—brothers. It was in the spring of the year that the youngest of these 
    <br>blackened his face and fasted. His dreams were propitious. Having 
    <br>ended his fast, he went secretly for his brothers at night, so that none in 
    <br>the village could overhear or find out the direction they intended to go. 
    <br>Though their drum was heard, yet that was a common occurrence. 
    <br>Having ended the usual formalities, he told how favorable his dreams 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">were, and that he had called them together to know if they would 
    <br>accompany him in a war excursion. They all answered they would. The 
    <br>third brother from the eldest, noted for his oddities, coming up with his 
    <br>war-club when his brother had ceased speaking, jumped up. ‘Yes,’ said 
    <br>he, ‘I will go, and this will be the way I will treat those I am going to 
    <br>fight;’ and he struck the post in the center of the lodge, and gave a yell. 
    <br>The others spoke to him, saying: ‘Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, when you are 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">in other people’s lodges.’ So he sat down. Then, in turn, they took the 
    <br>drum, and sang their songs, and closed with a feast. The youngest told 
    <br>them not to whisper their intention to their wives, but secretly to prepare

    <br>certain night, when they would depart immediately. Mudjikewis was 
    <br>loud in his demands for his moccasins. Several times his wife asked him 
    <br>the reason. ‘Besides,’ said she, ‘you have a good pair on.’ ‘Quick, quick,’ 
    <br>said he, ‘since you must know, we are going on a war excursion; so be 
    <br>quick.’ He thus revealed the secret. That night they met and started. The 
    <br>snow was on the ground, and they traveled all night, lest others should 
    <br>follow them. When it was daylight, the leader took snow and made a ball 
    <br>of it, then tossing it into the air, he said: ‘It was in this way I saw snow 
    <br>fall in a dream, so that I could not be tracked.’ And he told them to keep 
    <br>close to each other for fear of losing themselves, as the snow began to fall 
    <br>in very large flakes. Near as they walked, it was with difficulty they could 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">see each other. The snow continued falling all that day and the following 
    <br>night, so it was impossible to track them.

    <br>rear. One day, running suddenly forward, he gave the </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,Italic; font-size:14px">saw-saw-
    <br>quan</span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">,{footnote [War-whoop.]} and struck a tree with his war-club, and it 
    <br>broke into pieces as if struck with lightning. ‘Brothers,’ said he, ‘this will 
    <br>be the way I will serve those we are going to fight.’ The leader answered, 
    <br>‘Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, the one I lead you to is not to be thought of so 
    <br>lightly.’ Again he fell back and thought to himself: ‘What! what! who can 
    <br>this be he is leading us to?’ He felt fearful and was silent. Day after day 
    <br>they traveled on, till they came to an extensive plain, on the borders of 
    <br>which human bones were bleaching in the sun. The leader spoke: ‘They 
    <br>are the bones of those who have gone before us. None has ever yet 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">returned to tell the sad tale of their fate.’ Again Mudjikewis became 
    <br>restless, and, running forward, gave the accustomed yell. Advancing to a 
    <br>large rock which stood above the ground, he struck it, and it fell to 
    <br>pieces. ‘See, brothers,’ said he, ‘thus will I treat those whom we are going 
    <br>to fight.’ ‘Still, still,’ once more said the leader; ‘he to whom I am leading 
    <br>you is not to be compared to the rock.’

    <br>to see the remains of former warriors, who had been to the place where

    <br>place where they first saw the bones, beyond which no one had ever 
    <br>escaped. At last they came to a piece of rising ground, from which they 
    <br>plainly distinguished, sleeping on a distant mountain, a mammoth bear. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:330218px; width:454px; height:599px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The distance between them was very great, but the size of the animal 
    <br>caused him to be plainly seen. ‘There,’ said the leader, ‘it is he to whom I 
    <br>am leading you; here our troubles will commence, for he is a 
    <br>mishemokwa and a manito. It is he who has that we prize so dearly (i.e. 
    <br>wampum), to obtain which, the warriors whose bones we saw, sacrificed 
    <br>their lives. You must not be fearful: be manly. We shall find him asleep.’ 
    <br>Then the leader went forward and touched the belt around the animal’s 
    <br>neck. ‘This,’ said he, ‘is what we must get. It contains the wampum.’ 
    <br>Then they requested the eldest to try and slip the belt over the bear’s 
    <br>head, who appeared to be fast asleep, as he was not in the least disturbed 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">by the attempt to obtain the belt. All their efforts were in vain, till it came 
    <br>to the one next the youngest. He tried, and the belt moved nearly over 
    <br>the monster’s head, but he could get it no farther. Then the youngest 
    <br>one, and the leader, made his attempt, and succeeded. Placing it on the 
    <br>back of the oldest, he said, ‘Now we must run,’ and off they started. 
    <br>When one became fatigued with its weight, another would relieve him. 
    <br>Thus they ran till they had passed the bones of all former warriors, and 
    <br>were some distance beyond, when looking back, they saw the monster 
    <br>slowly rising. He stood some time before he missed his wampum. Soon 
    <br>they heard his tremendous howl, like distant thunder, slowly filling all 
    <br>the sky; and then they heard him speak and say, ‘Who can it be that has 
    <br>dared to steal my wampum? earth is not so large but that I can find 
    <br>them;’ and he descended from the hill in pursuit. As if convulsed, the 
    <br>earth shook with every jump he made. Very soon he approached the 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">party. They, however, kept the belt, exchanging it from one to another, 
    <br>and encouraging each other; but he gained on them fast. ‘Brothers,’ said 
    <br>the leader, ‘has never any one of you, when fasting, dreamed of some 
    <br>friendly spirit who would aid you as a guardian?’ A dead silence followed. 
    <br>‘Well,’ said he, ‘fasting, I dreamed of being in danger of instant death, 
    <br>when I saw a small lodge, with smoke curling from its top. An old man 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">lived in it, and I dreamed he helped me; and may it be verified soon,’ he 
    <br>said, running forward and giving the peculiar yell, and a howl as if the

Getting upon a piece of rising ground, behold! a 
    <br>lodge, with smoke curling from its top, appeared. This gave them all new 
    <br>strength, and they ran forward and entered it. The leader spoke to the 
    <br>old man who sat in the lodge, saying, ‘Nemesho, help us; we claim your 
    <br>protection, for the great bear will kill us.’ ‘Sit down and eat, my 
    <br>grandchildren,’ said the old man. ‘Who is a great manito?’ said he. ‘There 
    <br>is none but me; but let me look,’ and he opened the door of the lodge, 
    <br>when, lo! at a little distance he saw the enraged animal coming on, with 
    <br>slow but powerful leaps. He closed the door. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘he is indeed a 
    <br>great manito: my grandchildren, you will be the cause of my losing my 
    <br>life; you asked my protection, and I granted it; so now, come what may, I 
    <br>will protect you. When the bear arrives at the door, you must run out of 
    <br>the other door of the lodge.’ Then putting his hand to the side of the 
    <br>lodge where he sat, he brought out a bag which he opened. Taking out 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">two small black dogs, he placed them before him. ‘These are the ones I 
    <br>use when I fight,’ said he; and he commenced patting with both hands 
    <br>the sides of one of them, and he began to swell out, so that he soon filled 
    <br>the lodge by his bulk; and he had great strong teeth. When he attained 
    <br>his full size he growled, and from that moment, as from instinct, he 
    <br>jumped out at the door and met the bear, who in another leap would 
    <br>have reached the lodge. A terrible combat ensued. The skies rang with 
    <br>the howls of the fierce monsters. The remaining dog soon took the field. 
    <br>The brothers, at the onset, took the advice of the old man, and escaped 
    <br>through the opposite side of the lodge. They had not proceeded far 
    <br>before they heard the dying cry of one of the dogs, and soon after of the 
    <br>other. ‘Well,’ said the leader, ‘the old man will share their fate: so run; he 
    <br>will soon be after us.’ They started with fresh vigor, for they had received 
    <br>food from the old man: but very soon the bear came in sight, and again 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">was fast gaining upon them. Again the leader asked the brothers if they 
    <br>could do nothing for their safety. All were silent. The leader, running 
    <br>forward, did as before. ‘I dreamed,’ he cried, ‘that, being in great trouble, 
    <br>an old man helped me who was a manito; we shall soon see his lodge.’ 
    <br>Taking courage, they still went on. After going a short distance they saw 
    <br>the lodge of the old manito. They entered immediately and claimed his 
    <br>protection, telling him a manito was after them. The old man, setting 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">meat before them, said: ‘Eat! who is a manito? there is no manito but 
    <br>me; there is none whom I fear;’ and the earth trembled as the monster 
    <br>advanced. The old man opened the door and saw him coming. He shut it

    <br>me.’ Procuring his medicine-sack, he took out his small war-clubs of 
    <br>black stone, and told the young men to run through the other side of the 
    <br>lodge. As he handled the clubs, they became very large, and the old man 
    <br>stepped out just as the bear reached the door. Then striking him with 
    <br>one of the clubs, it broke in pieces; the bear stumbled. Renewing the 
    <br>attempt with the other war-club, that also was broken, but the bear fell 
    <br>senseless. Each blow the old man gave him sounded like a clap of 
    <br>thunder, and the howls of the bear ran along till they filled the heavens. 
    <br></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:72px; top:332093px; width:454px; height:453px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">The young men had now run some distance, when they looked back. 
    <br>They could see that the bear was recovering from the blows. First he 
    <br>moved his paws, and soon they saw him rise on his feet. The old man 
    <br>shared the fate of the first, for they now heard his cries as he was torn in 
    <br>pieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them. Not 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">yet discouraged, the young men kept on their way; but the bear was now 
    <br>so close, that the leader once more applied to his brothers, but they could 
    <br>do nothing. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘my dreams will soon be exhausted; after this 
    <br>I have but one more.’ He advanced, invoking his guardian spirit to aid 
    <br>him. ‘Once,’ said he, ‘I dreamed that, being sorely pressed, I came to a 
    <br>large lake, on the shore of which was a canoe, partly out of water, having 
    <br>ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,’ he cried, ‘we shall soon get it.’ 
    <br>And so it was, even as he had said. Coming to the lake, they saw the 
    <br>canoe with ten paddles, and immediately they embarked. Scarcely had 
    <br>they reached the center of the lake, when they saw the bear arrive at its 
    <br>borders. Lifting himself on his hind legs, he looked all around. Then he 
    <br>waded into the water; then losing his footing he turned back, and 
    <br>commenced making the circuit of the lake. Meantime the party remained 
    <br>stationary in the center to watch his movements. He traveled all around, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">till at last he came to the place from whence he started. Then he 
    <br>commenced drinking up the water, and they saw the current fast setting 
    <br>in towards his open mouth. The leader encouraged them to paddle hard 
    <br>for the opposite shore. When only a short distance from land, the current 
    <br>had increased so much, that they were drawn back by it, and all their 
    <br>efforts to reach it were in vain.

    <br>‘Now is the time, Mudjikewis,’ said he, ‘to show your prowess. Take 
    <br>courage and sit at the bow of the canoe; and when it approaches his

    <br>stunned by the blow. But before Mudjikewis could renew it, the monster 
    <br>disgorged all the water he had drank, with a force which sent the canoe 
    <br>with great velocity to the opposite shore. Instantly leaving the canoe,

    <br>himself, by actions and words, to cheer them up; and once more he asked 
    <br>them if they thought of nothing, or could do nothing for their rescue; 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and, as before, all were silent. ‘Then,’ he said, ‘this is the last time I can 
    <br>apply to my guardian spirit. Now, if we do not succeed, our fates are 
    <br>decided.’ He ran forward, invoking his spirit with great earnestness, and 
    <br>gave the yell. ‘We shall soon arrive,’ said he to his brothers, ‘at the place 
    <br>where my last guardian spirit dwells. In him I place great confidence. Do 
    <br>not, do not be afraid, or your limbs will be fear-bound. We shall soon 
    <br>reach his lodge. Run, run,’ he cried.

    <br>we had left him, the head directing his sister, in order to procure food, 
    <br>where to place the magic arrows, and speaking at long intervals. One day 
    <br>the sister saw the eyes of the head brighten, as if with pleasure. At last it 
    <br>spoke. ‘Oh, sister,’ it said, ‘in what a pitiful situation you have been the 
    <br>cause of placing me! Soon, very soon, a party of young men will arrive 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">and apply to me for aid; but alas! How can I give what I would have done 
    <br>with so much pleasure? Nevertheless, take two arrows, and place them 
    <br>where you have been in the habit of placing the others, and have meat 
    <br>prepared and cooked before they arrive. When you hear them coming 
    <br>and calling on my name, go out and say, “Alas! it is long ago that an 
    <br>accident befell him. I was the cause of it.” If they still come near, ask 
    <br>them in, and set meat before them. And now you must follow my 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">directions strictly. When the bear is near, go out and meet him. You will 
    <br>take my medicine-sack, bows and arrows, and my head. You must then 
    <br>untie the sack, and spread out before you my paints of all colors, my war-

    <br>you can, crying aloud, “See, this is my deceased brother’s head.” He will 
    <br>then fall senseless. By this time the young men will have eaten, and you 
    <br>will call them to your assistance. You must then cut the carcass into 
    <br>pieces, yes, into small pieces, and scatter them to the four winds; for,

    <br>done as he said. She had only time to prepare the meat, when the voice of 
    <br>the leader was heard calling upon Iamo for aid. The woman went out and 
    <br>said as her brother had directed. But the war party being closely 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">pursued, came up to the lodge. She invited them in, and placed the meat 
    <br>before them. While they were eating, they heard the bear approaching. 
    <br>Untying the medicine-sack and taking the head, she had all in readiness 
    <br>for his approach. When he came up she did as she had been told; and, 
    <br>before she had expended the paints and feathers, the bear began to 
    <br>totter, but, still advancing, came close to the woman. Saying as she was 
    <br>commanded, she then took the head, and cast it as far from her as she 
    <br>could. As it rolled along the ground, the blood, excited by the feelings of 
    <br>the head in this terrible scene, gushed from the nose and mouth. The 
    <br>bear, tottering, soon fell with a tremendous noise. Then she cried for 
    <br>help, and the young men came rushing out, having partially regained 
    <br>their strength and spirits.

    <br>then scattered in every direction. While thus employed, happening to

    <br>saw starting up and turning off in every direction small black bears, such 
    <br>as are seen at the present day. The country was soon overspread with

    <br>flight, the young men gave up the idea of ever returning to their own 
    <br>country, and game being plenty, they determined to remain where they 
    <br>now were. One day they moved off some distance from the lodge for the 
    <br>purpose of hunting, having left the wampum with the woman. They were 
    <br>very successful, and amused themselves, as all young men do when 
    <br>alone, by talking and jesting with each other. One of them spoke and 
    <br>said, ‘We have all this sport to ourselves; let us go and ask our sister if 
    <br>she will not let us bring the head to this place, as it is still alive. It may be 
    <br>pleased to hear us talk, and be in our company. In the meantime take 
    <br>food to our sister.’ They went and requested the head. She told them to 
    <br>take it, and they took it to their hunting-grounds, and tried to amuse it, 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure. One day, while 
    <br>busy in their encampment, they were unexpectedly attacked by unknown 
    <br>Indians. The skirmish was long contested and bloody; many of their foes 
    <br>were slain, but still they were thirty to one. The young men fought 
    <br>desperately till they were all killed. The attacking party then retreated to 
    <br>a height of ground, to muster their men, and to count the number of 
    <br>missing and slain. One of their young men had stayed away, and, in 
    <br>endeavoring to overtake them, came to the place where the head was 
    <br>hung up. Seeing that alone retain animation, he eyed it for some time 
    <br>with fear and surprise. However, he took it down and opened the sack, 
    <br>and was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers, one of which he 
    <br>placed on his head.

    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">he threw down the head and sack, and told them how he had found it, 
    <br>and that the sack was full of paints and feathers. They all looked at the 
    <br>head and made sport of it. Numbers of the young men took the paint and 
    <br>painted themselves, and one of the party took the head by the hair and 
    <br>said—

    <br>search of it. The young men she found lying within short distances of 
    <br>each other, dead, and covered with wounds. Various other bodies lay 
    <br>scattered in different directions around them. She searched for the head 
    <br>and sack, but they were nowhere to be found. She raised her voice and 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">wept, and blackened her face. Then she walked in different directions, till 
    <br>she came to the place from whence the head had been taken. Then she 
    <br>found the magic bow and arrows, where the young men, ignorant of their 
    <br>qualities, had left them. She thought to herself that she would find her 
    <br>brother’s head, and came to a piece of rising ground, and there saw some 
    <br>of his paints and feathers. These she carefully put up, and hung upon the 
    <br>branch of a tree till her return.

    <br>used a charm, common among Indians when they wish to meet with a 
    <br>kind reception. On applying to the old man and woman of the lodge, she 
    <br>was kindly received. She made known her errand. The old man promised 
    <br>to aid her, and told her the head was hung up before the council-fire, and 
    <br>that the chiefs of the village, with their young men, kept watch over it 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">continually. The former are considered as manitoes. She said she only 
    <br>wished to see it, and would be satisfied if she could only get to the door 
    <br>of the lodge. She knew she had not sufficient power to take it by force. 
    <br>‘Come with me,’ said the Indian, ‘I will take you there.’ They went, and 
    <br>they took their seats near the door. The council-lodge was filled with 
    <br>warriors, amusing themselves with games, and constantly keeping up a 
    <br>fire to smoke the head, as they said, to make dry meat. They saw the 
    <br>head move, and not knowing what to make of it, one spoke and said: ‘Ha! 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">ha! It is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke.’ The sister looked up 
    <br>from the door, and her eyes met those of her brother, and tears rolled

    <br>games. The young man did not know he was telling a lie to the woman’s 
    <br>advantage, who by that means escaped.

    <br>country. Coming to the spot where the bodies of her adopted brothers 
    <br>lay, she placed them together, their feet toward the east. Then taking an 
    <br>ax which she had, she cast it up into the air, crying out, ‘Brothers, get up 
    <br>from under it, or it will fall on you.’ This she repeated three times, and 
    <br>the third time the brothers all arose and stood on their feet.

    <br>said he, ‘I have overslept myself.’ ‘No, indeed,’ said one of the others, ‘do 
    <br>you not know we were all killed, and that it is our sister who has brought 
    <br>us to life?’ The young men took the bodies of their enemies and burned 
    <br>them. Soon after, the woman went to procure wives for them, in a distant 
    <br>country, they knew not where; but she returned with ten young women, 
    <br>which she gave to the ten young men, beginning with the eldest. 
    <br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size:14px">Mudjikewis stepped to and fro, uneasy lest he should not get the one he 
    <br>liked. But he was not disappointed, for she fell to his lot. And they were 
    <br>well matched, for she was a female magician. They then all moved into a 
    <br>very large lodge, and their sister told them that the women must now 
    <br>take turns in going to her brother’s head every night, trying to untie it. 
    <br>They all said they would do so with pleasure. The eldest made the first 
    <br>attempt, and with a rushing noise she fled through the air.

    <br>the lodge and drove them out. This last night they were all driven out, 
    <br>and the young woman carried off the head.

    <br>brother.’ And as soon as they heard it, they went to a small lodge where 
    <br>the black body of Iamo lay. His sister commenced cutting the neck part, 
    <br>from which the neck had been severed. She cut so deep as to cause it to 
    <br>bleed; and the others who were present, by rubbing the body and 
    <br>applying medicines, expelled the blackness. In the meantime, the one 
    <br>who brought it, by cutting the neck of the head, caused that also to bleed.

    <br>of their troubles, and they had spent some time joyfully together, when 
    <br>Iamo said: ‘Now I will divide the wampum,’ and getting the belt which 
    <br>contained it, he commenced with the eldest, giving it in equal portions. 
    <br>But the youngest got the most splendid and beautiful, as the bottom of 
    <br>the belt held the richest and rarest.
